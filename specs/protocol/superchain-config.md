## Overview

The SuperchainConfig contract is used to manage global configuration values for multiple OP Chains
within a single Superchain network.

## Invariants

### iSUPC-001: The Guardian and Pause Deputy must be able to trigger the Pause Mechanism

We require that the `SuperchainConfig` is constructed such that both the
[Guardian](./stage-1.md#guardian) and the [Pause Deputy](./stage-1.md#pause-deputy) must be able to
trigger the [Pause Mechanism](./stage-1.md#pause-mechanism) at any time.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

Existing recovery runbooks would not function as expected if the `SuperchainConfig` prevented one
of these actors from triggering the pause as needed.

### iSUPC-002: The Guardian must be able to reset or undo the Pause Mechanism

We require that the `SuperchainConfig` is constructed such that the
[Guardian](./stage-1.md#guardian) must be able to reset or unpause the
[Pause Mechanism](./stage-1.md#pause-mechanism) at any time.

#### Impact

**Severity: Medium**

If the Pause Mechanism cannot be reset then it cannot be used again without intervention from the
[Upgrade Controller](./stage-1.md#upgrade-controller). We consider this to be a Medium severity
issue because the Upgrade Controller will have several months to coordinate such a fix assuming
that [iSUPC-001][iSUPC-001] holds.

## Function Specification

### initialize

- MUST only be triggerable once.
- MUST set the value of the Guardian role.
- MUST set the value of the pause expiry period.

### guardian

Returns the address of the current [Guardian](./stage-1.md#guardian).

### pause

Allows the [Guardian](./stage-1.md#guardian) to trigger the
[Pause Mechanism](./stage-1.md#pause-mechanism). `pause` takes an address
[Pause Identifier](./stage-1.md#pause-identifier) as an input. This identifier determines which
systems or chains are affected by the pause.

- MUST revert if called by an address other than the Guardian.
- MUST revert if the pausable flag for the given identifier is set to 1 (used/unavailable).
- MUST set the pause timestamp for the given identifier to the current block timestamp.
- MUST set the pausable flag for the given identifier to 1 (used/unavailable) to prevent repeated
  pauses without a reset.

### unpause

Allows the [Guardian](./stage-1.md#guardian) to explicitly unpause the system for a given
[Pause Identifier](./stage-1.md#pause-identifier) rather than waiting for the pause to expire.
Unpausing a specific identifier does NOT unpause the global pause (zero address identifier). If the
global pause is active, all systems will remain paused even if their specific identifiers are
unpaused.

- MUST revert if called by an address other than the Guardian.
- MUST set the pause timestamp for the given identifier to 0, representing "not paused".
- MUST set the pausable flag for the given identifier to 0 (ready to pause), allowing the pause
  mechanism to be used again.

### pausable

Allows any user to check if the [Pause Mechanism](./stage-1.md#pause-mechanism) can be triggered
for a specific [Pause Identifier](./stage-1.md#pause-identifier). The pausable status of a specific
identifier is independent of the pausable status of the global pause (zero address identifier).

- MUST return true if the pausable flag for the given identifier is 0 (ready to pause).
- MUST return false if the pausable flag for the given identifier is 1 (used/unavailable).

### paused

Allows any user to check if the system is currently paused for a specific
[Pause Identifier](./stage-1.md#pause-identifier).

- MUST return true if the pause timestamp for the given identifier is non-zero AND not expired
  (current time < pause timestamp + expiry duration).
- MUST return false otherwise.

### expiration

Returns the timestamp at which the pause for a given
[Pause Identifier](./stage-1.md#pause-identifier) will expire. This function only returns the
expiration for the specific identifier provided.

- MUST return the pause timestamp plus the configured expiry duration if the pause timestamp is non-zero.
- MUST return 0 if the pause timestamp is 0 (system is not paused) for the given identifier.

### reset

Allows the [Guardian](./stage-1.md#guardian) to reset the pause mechanism for a given
[Pause Identifier](./stage-1.md#pause-identifier), allowing it to be used again.

- MUST revert if called by an address other than the Guardian.
- MUST set the pausable flag for the given identifier to 0 (ready to pause).
- MUST NOT modify the pause timestamp for the given identifier.
- NOTE: Resetting the pausable flag for a specific identifier does not affect the pause status. If
  a system is currently paused, it will remain paused until explicitly unpaused or until the pause
  expires.
