## Overview

With fault proofs, the withdrawal path changes such that withdrawals submitted to the `OptimismPortal` are proven
against [output proposals][g-l2-proposal] submitted as a [`FaultDisputeGame`][fdg] prior to being finalized. Output
proposals are now finalized whenever a dispute game resolves in their favor.

## Legacy Semantics

The `OptimismPortal` uses the `L2OutputOracle` in the withdrawal path of the rollup to allow users to prove the
presence of their withdrawal inside of the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` account storage root, which can be retrieved by
providing a preimage to an output root in the oracle. The oracle currently holds a list of all L2 outputs proposed to
L1 by a permissioned PROPOSER key. The list in the contract has the following properties:

- It must always be sorted by the L2 Block Number that the output proposal is claiming it corresponds to.
- All outputs in the list that are > `FINALIZATION_PERIOD_SECONDS` old are considered "finalized." The separator
  between unfinalized/finalized outputs moves forwards implicitly as time passes.

![legacy-l2oo-list](../../static/assets/legacy-l2oo-list.png)

Currently, if there is a faulty output proposed by the permissioned `PROPOSER` key, a separate permissioned
`CHALLENGER` key may intervene. Note that the `CHALLENGER` role effectively has god-mode privileges, and can currently
act without proving that the outputs they're deleting are indeed incorrect. By deleting an output proposal, the
challenger also deletes all output proposals in front of it.

With the upgrade to the Fault Proof Alpha Chad system, output proposals are no longer sent to the `L2OutputOracle`, but
to the `DisputeGameFactory` in order to be fault proven. In contrast to the L2OO, an incorrect output proposal is not
deleted, but proven to be incorrect. The semantics of finalization timelines and the definition of a "finalized" output
proposal also change. Since the DisputeGameFactory fulfills the same role as the L2OutputOracle in a post fault proofs
world by tracking proposed outputs, and the L2OO's semantics are incompatible with the new system, the L2OO is no
longer required.

## FPAC `OptimismPortal` Mods Specification

### Roles - `OptimismPortal`

- `Guardian`: Permissioned actor able to pause the portal, blacklist dispute games, and change the
  `RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE`.

### New `DeployConfig` Variables

| Name                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS` | The amount of time given to the `Guardian` role to blacklist a resolved dispute game before any withdrawals proven against it can be finalized, in case of system failure. |
| `PROOF_MATURITY_DELAY_SECONDS`        | Formerly `FINALIZATION_PERIOD_SECONDS` in the `L2OutputOracle`, defines the duration that must pass between proving and finalizing a withdrawal.                           |
| `RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE`                 | The dispute game type that the portal uses for the withdrawal path.                                                                                                        |

### Data Structures

Withdrawals are now proven against dispute games, which have immutable "root claims" representing the output root
being proposed. The `ProvenWithdrawal` struct is now defined as:

```solidity
/// @notice Represents a proven withdrawal.
/// @custom:field disputeGameProxy The address of the dispute game proxy that the withdrawal was proven against.
/// @custom:field timestamp        Timestamp at which the withdrawal was proven.
struct ProvenWithdrawal {
    IDisputeGame disputeGameProxy;
    uint64 timestamp;
}
```

### State Layout

#### Legacy Spacers

Spacers should be added at the following storage slots in the `OptimismPortal` so that they may not be reused:

| Slot | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `52` | Legacy `provenWithdrawals` mapping. Withdrawals proven against the `L2OutputOracle`'s output proposals will be deleted upon the upgrade. |
| `54` | Legacy `L2OutputOracle` address.                                                                                                         |

#### New State Variables

**`DisputeGameFactory` address**

```solidity
/// @notice Address of the DisputeGameFactory.
/// @custom:network-specific
DisputeGameFactory public disputeGameFactory;
```

**Respected Game Type**

```solidity
/// @notice The respected game type of the `OptimismPortal`.
///         Can be changed by Guardian.
GameType public respectedGameType;
```

**Respected Game Type Updated Timestamp**

```solidity
/// @notice The timestamp at which the respected game type was last updated.
uint64 public respectedGameTypeUpdatedAt;
```

**New `ProvenWithdrawals` mapping**

```solidity
/// @notice A mapping of withdrawal hashes to `ProvenWithdrawal` data.
mapping(bytes32 => ProvenWithdrawal) public provenWithdrawals;
```

**Blacklisted `DisputeGame` mapping**

```solidity
/// @notice A mapping of dispute game addresses to whether or not they are blacklisted.
mapping(IDisputeGame => bool) public disputeGameBlacklist;
```

### `proveWithdrawalTransaction` modifications

Proving a withdrawal transaction now proves against an output root in a dispute game, rather than one in the
`L2OutputOracle`.

#### Interface

The type signature of the function does not change, but the purpose of the second argument transitions from providing
an index within the `L2OutputOracle`'s `l2Outputs` array to an index within the `DisputeGameFactory`'s list of created
games.

```solidity
/// @notice Proves a withdrawal transaction.
/// @param _tx               Withdrawal transaction to finalize.
/// @param _disputeGameIndex Index of the dispute game to prove the withdrawal against.
/// @param _outputRootProof  Inclusion proof of the L2ToL1MessagePasser contract's storage root.
/// @param _withdrawalProof  Inclusion proof of the withdrawal in L2ToL1MessagePasser contract.
function proveWithdrawalTransaction(
    Types.WithdrawalTransaction memory _tx,
    uint256 _disputeGameIndex,
    Types.OutputRootProof calldata _outputRootProof,
    bytes[] calldata _withdrawalProof
) external whenNotPaused;
```

#### New Invariants - `proveWithdrawalTransaction`

**Trusted `GameType`**
The `DisputeGameFactory` can create many different types of dispute games, delineated by their `GameType`. The game
type of the dispute game fetched from the factory's list at `_disputeGameIndex` must be of type `RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE`.
The call should revert on all other game types it encounters.

#### Changed Invariants - `proveWithdrawalTransaction`

**Re-proving withdrawals**
Users being able to re-prove withdrawals, in special cases, is still necessary to prevent user withdrawals from being
bricked. It is kept to protect honest users when they prove their withdrawal inside of a malicious proposal. The
timestamp of re-proven withdrawals is still reset.

1. **Old:** Re-proving is allowed if the output root at the proven withdrawal's `l2OutputIndex` changed in the
   `L2OutputOracle`.
2. **New:** Re-proving is allowed at any time by the user. When a withdrawal is re-proven, its proof maturity delay is
   reset.

### `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` modifications

Finalizing a withdrawal transaction now references a `DisputeGame` to determine the status of the output proposal that
the withdrawal was proven against.

#### New Invariants - `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`

**Trusted `GameType`**
The `DisputeGameFactory` can create many different types of dispute games, delineated by their `GameType`. The game
type of the dispute game fetched from the factory's list at `_disputeGameIndex` must be of type `RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE`.
The call should revert on all other game types it encounters.

**Respected Game Type Updated**
A withdrawal may never be finalized if the dispute game was created before the respected game type was last updated.

**Dispute Game Blacklist**
The `Guardian` role can blacklist certain `DisputeGame` addresses in the event of a system failure. If the address of
the dispute game that the withdrawal was proven against is present in the `disputeGameBlacklist` mapping, the call
should always revert.

**Dispute Game Maturity**
See ["Air-gap"](#air-gap)

#### Changed Invariants - `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction`

**Output Proposal Validity**
Instead of checking if the proven withdrawal's output proposal has existed for longer the legacy finalization period,
we check if the dispute game has resolved in the root claim's favor. A `FaultDisputeGame` must never be considered to
have resolved in the `rootClaim`'s favor unless its `status()` is equal to `DEFENDER_WINS`.

### Air-gap

Given it's own section due to it's importance, the air gap is an enforced period of time between a dispute game's
resolution and users being able to finalize withdrawals that were proven against its root claim. When the `DisputeGame`
resolves globally, it stores the timestamp. The portal's `finalizeWithdrawalTransaction` function asserts that
`DISPUTE_GAME_FINALITY_DELAY_SECONDS` have passed since the resolution timestamp before allowing any withdrawals proven
against the dispute game to be finalized. Because the `FaultDisputeGame` is a trusted implementation set by the owner
of the `DisputeGameFactory`, it is safe to trust that this value is honestly set.

#### Blacklisting `DisputeGame`s

A new method is added to assign `DisputeGame`s in the `disputeGameBlacklist` mapping mentioned in
["State Layout"](#state-layout), in the event that a dispute game is detected to have resolved incorrectly. The only
actor who may call this function is the `Guardian` role.

Blacklisting a dispute game means that no withdrawals proven against it will be allowed to finalize
(per the "Dispute Game Blacklist" invariant), and they must re-prove against a new dispute game that resolves correctly.
The Portal's guardian role is obligated to blacklist any dispute games that it deems to have resolved incorrectly.
Withdrawals proven against a blacklisted dispute game are not prevented from re-proving or being finalized in the
future.

#### Blacklisting a full `GameType`

In the event of a catastrophic failure, we can upgrade the `OptimismPortal` proxy to an implementation with a
different `RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE`. All pending withdrawals that reference a different game type will not be allowed to
finalize and must re-prove, due to the "Trusted `GameType`" invariant. This should generally be avoided, but allows
for a blanket blacklist of pending withdrawals corresponding to the current `RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE`. Depending on if
we're okay with the tradeoffs, this also may be the most efficient way to upgrade the dispute game in the future.

### Proxy Upgrade

Upgrading the `OptimismPortal` proxy to an implementation that follows this specification will invalidate all pending
withdrawals. This means that all users with pending withdrawals will need to re-prove their withdrawals against an
output proposal submitted in the form of a `DisputeGame`.

## Permissioned `FaultDisputeGame`

As a fallback to permissioned proposals, a child contract of the `FaultDisputeGame` will be created that has 2 new
roles: the `PROPOSER` and a `CHALLENGER` (or set of challengers). Each interaction
(`move` \[`attack` / `defend`\], `step`, `resolve` / `resolveClaim`, `addLocalData`, etc.) will be permissioned to the
`CHALLENGER` key, and the `initialize` function will be permissioned to the `PROPOSER` key.

In the event that we'd like to switch back to permissioned proposals, we can change the `RESPECTED_GAME_TYPE` in the
`OptimismPortal` to a deployment of the `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame`.

### Roles - `PermissionedDisputeGame`

- `PROPOSER` - Actor that can create a `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame` and participate in the games they've created.
- `CHALLENGER` - Actor(s) that can participate in a `PermissionedFaultDisputeGame`.

### Modifications

**State Layout**

2 new immutables:

```solidity
/// @notice The `PROPOSER` role.
address public immutable PROPOSER;

/// @notice The `CHALLENGER` role.
address public immutable CHALLENGER;
```

**Functions**

Every function that can mutate state should be overridden to add a check that either:

1. The `msg.sender` has the `CHALLENGER` role.
2. The `msg.sender` has the `PROPOSER` role.

If the `msg.sender` does not have either role, the function must revert.

The exception is the `initialize` function, which may only be called if the `tx.origin` is the `PROPOSER` role.
