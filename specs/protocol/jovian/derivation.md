The Jovian network upgrade timestamp defines the timestamp at which all functionality in this document is considered the
consensus rules for an OP Stack based network.

The upgrade transaction details below are based on a branch at commit hash 7daaabbf2c2cce892aa171bc7e1331ad31bcc8ca, and
will be updated once a contracts release is made.

On the activation block, a set of deposit transaction based upgrade transactions are deterministically generated by the
derivation pipeline in the following order:

## Network Upgrade Transactions

### L1Block Deployment
<!-- Generated with: ./scripts/run_gen_predeploy_docs.sh --optimism-repo-path ../optimism --fork-name Jovian
--contract-name L1Block --from-address 0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000006 --from-address-nonce 0
--git-commit-hash 7daaabbf2c2cce892aa171bc7e1331ad31bcc8ca --eth-rpc-url https://optimism.rpc.subquery.network/public
--proxy-address 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015 --copy-contract-bytecode true -->

The `L1Block` contract is deployed.

A deposit transaction is derived with the following attributes:

- `from`: `0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000006`
- `to`: `null`
- `mint`: `0`
- `value`: `0`
- `nonce`: `0`
- `gasLimit`: `444775`
- `data`: `0x0x608060405234801561001057600080...` ([full bytecode](../../../specs/static/bytecode/jovian-l1-block-deployment.txt))
- `sourceHash`: `0x98faf23b9795967bc0b1c543144739d50dba3ea40420e77ad6ca9848dbfb62e8`,
  computed with the "Upgrade-deposited" type, with `intent = "Jovian: L1Block Deployment"`

This results in the Jovian L1Block contract being deployed to
`0x3Ba4007f5C922FBb33C454B41ea7a1f11E83df2C`, to verify:

```bash
cast compute-address --nonce=0 0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000006
Computed Address: 0x3Ba4007f5C922FBb33C454B41ea7a1f11E83df2C
```

Verify `sourceHash`:

```bash
cast keccak $(cast concat-hex 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 $(cast keccak "Jovian: L1Block Deployment"))
# 0x98faf23b9795967bc0b1c543144739d50dba3ea40420e77ad6ca9848dbfb62e8
```

Verify `data`:

```bash
git checkout 7daaabbf2c2cce892aa171bc7e1331ad31bcc8ca
make build-contracts
jq -r ".bytecode.object" packages/contracts-bedrock/forge-artifacts/L1Block.sol/L1Block.json
```

This transaction MUST deploy a contract with the following code hash
`0xf7b6ef0de2a53625d467d98c2932a5a5d64ffa1a331ebbde5bb06e2591b5835a`.

To verify the code hash:

```bash
git checkout 7daaabbf2c2cce892aa171bc7e1331ad31bcc8ca
make build-contracts
cast k $(jq -r ".deployedBytecode.object" packages/contracts-bedrock/forge-artifacts/L1Block.sol/L1Block.json)
```

### L1Block Proxy Update

This transaction updates the L1Block Proxy ERC-1967
implementation slot to point to the new L1Block deployment.

A deposit transaction is derived with the following attributes:

- `from`: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- `to`: `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015` (L1Block Proxy)
- `mint`: `0`
- `value`: `0`
- `gasLimit`: `50,000`
- `data`: `0x3659cfe60000000000000000000000003ba4007f5c922fbb33c454b41ea7a1f11e83df2c`
- `sourceHash`: `0x08447273a4fbce97bc8c515f97ac74efc461f6a4001553712f31ebc11288bad2`
  computed with the "Upgrade-deposited" type, with `intent = "Jovian: L1Block Proxy Update"`

Verify data:

```bash
cast concat-hex $(cast sig "upgradeTo(address)") $(cast abi-encode "upgradeTo(address)" 0x3Ba4007f5C922FBb33C454B41ea7a1f11E83df2C)
# 0x3659cfe60000000000000000000000003ba4007f5c922fbb33c454b41ea7a1f11e83df2c
```

Verify `sourceHash`:

```bash
cast keccak $(cast concat-hex 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 $(cast keccak "Jovian: L1Block Proxy Update"))
# 0x08447273a4fbce97bc8c515f97ac74efc461f6a4001553712f31ebc11288bad2
```
