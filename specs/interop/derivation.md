## Overview

New derivation rules are added to guarantee integrity of cross chain messages.
The fork choice rule is updated to fork out unsafe blocks that contain invalid
executing messages.

## Invariants

- An executing message MUST have a corresponding initiating message
- The initiating message referenced in an executing message MUST come from a chain in its dependency set
- A block MUST be considered invalid if it is built with any invalid executing messages
- The block number `n` is `>` the activation block number, see [Activation Block](#activation-block).
- The timestamp `t` of the identifier MUST be:
  - `t <= execution_timestamp`, where `execution_timestamp` is the timestamp of the block
    that includes the executing message.
  - `t > execution_timestamp - expiry_window`, where `expiry_window` is the expiry window in seconds.

L2 blocks that produce invalid executing messages MUST not be allowed to be considered safe.
They MAY optimistically exist as unsafe blocks for some period of time. An L2 block that is invalidated
because it includes invalid executing messages MUST be replaced by a deposits only block at the same
block height. This guarantees progression of the chain, ensuring that an infinite loop of processing
the same block in the proof system is not possible.

## Activation Block

The activation block is the first block that has a timestamp higher or equal to the
interop network upgrade timestamp.
The activation block timestamp may not exactly match the upgrade timestamp.

The genesis block is not technically considered an activation-block, as forks are already active.
However, the genesis block does not contain transactions, and thus also meets the activation criteria.

The activation block has several special properties and constraints:

- It MUST NOT include any non-deposit-type transactions.
  Sequencers, when building the fork activation block, MUST set `noTxPool` to `true`
  in the execution payload attributes for this block, instructing the builder to exclude user transactions.
- Messages MUST NOT be executed in this block. This is implemented by only processing deposit-type transactions.
- Any contract log events MUST NOT count as valid initiating messages.
  Verifiers may use the activation block as an anchor point, without indexing the block-contents.
- The derivation pipeline MUST enforce that the sequencer has not included any user transactions in
  the batch covering the upgrade's activation block. If the sequencer includes any user transactions
  within the activation block, this block and the remaining span batch it originated from
  (if part of a span batch) MUST be dropped,
  following the batch-dropping rules introduced in the
  [Holocene upgrade span-batch rules](../protocol/holocene/derivation.md#span-batches).

## Replacing Invalid Blocks

When the [cross chain dependency resolution](./messaging.md#resolving-cross-chain-safety) determines
that a block contains an [invalid message](./messaging.md#invalid-messages), the block is replaced
by a block with the same inputs, except for the transactions included. The transactions from the
original block are trimmed to include only deposit transactions plus an
[optimistic block info deposit transaction](#optimistic-block-deposited-transaction), which is appended
to the trimmed transaction list.

### Optimistic Block Deposited Transaction

An Optimistic Block Deposited Transaction is a system deposited transaction,
inserted into the replacement block,
to signal when a previously derived local-safe block (the "optimistic" block) was invalidated.

This transaction MUST have the following values:

1. `from` is `0xdeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead0002`, like the address of the
   [L1 Attributes depositor account](../protocol/deposits.md#l1-attributes-depositor-account), but incremented by 1
2. `to` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (the zero address as no EVM code execution is expected).
3. `mint` is `0`
4. `value` is `0`
5. `gasLimit` is set `36000` gas, to cover intrinsic costs, processing costs, and margin for change.
6. `isSystemTx` is set to `false`.
7. `data` is the preimage of the [L2 output root]
   of the replaced block. i.e. `version_byte || payload` without applying the `keccak256` hashing.
8. `sourceHash` is computed with a new deposit source-hash domain, see below.

This system-initiated transaction for L1 attributes is not charged any ETH for its allocated
`gasLimit`, as it is considered part of state-transition processing.

[L2 output root]: ../glossary.md#l2-output-root-proposals

#### Optimistic Block Source-hash

The source hash is [computed](../protocol/deposits.md#source-hash-computation)
with a source-hash domain: `4` (instead of `1`),
combined with the [L2 output root] of the optimistic block that was invalidated.

The source-hash is thus computed as:
`keccak256(bytes32(uint256(4)), outputRoot))`.

## Network Upgrade Transactions

The interop network upgrade timestamp defines the timestamp at which all functionality in this document is considered
the consensus rules for an OP Stack based network.

The upgrade transaction details below are based on a nightly release at commit
hash `71c460ec7c7c05791ddd841b97bcb664a1f0c753`, and will be updated once a
contracts release is made.

On the [activation block](#activation-block), a set of deposit transaction
based upgrade transactions are deterministically generated by the derivation pipeline in the following order:

```

### L2 Gas Limit Requirements

This upgrade requires `3_270_000` in gas, plus `50_000` gas if the CrossL2Inbox proxy is initialized in the same block.
In order to upgrade successfully the following invariant MUST be maintained:

```plaintext
MaxResourceLimit + SystemTxMaxGas + UpgradeGasUsage ≤ L2GasLimit
```

With MaxResourceLimit set to `20_000_000` and SystemTxMaxGas set to `1_000_000`,
this mean every upgrading chain MUST have their L2GasLimit set to greater than
`24_320_000`.

## CrossL2InboxProxy Initialization

On the first block at or after the interop  [activation block](#activation-block), where the current chain is in a
dependency set with two or more active chains, a deposit transaction based upgrade transaction is deterministically
generated by the derivation pipeline:

### CrossL2Inbox Proxy Update

This transaction updates the CrossL2Inbox Proxy ERC-1967
implementation slot to point to the CrossL2Inbox deployment deployed at the interop activation block.

A deposit transaction is derived with the following attributes:

- `from`: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
- `to`: `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022` (CrossL2Inbox Proxy)

```

### L2 Gas Limit Requirements

Initializing the CrossL2InboxProxy requires `50_000` in gas. This fits within the standard SystemTxMaxGas of `1_000_000`
even allowing for the gas used by the
[L1 attributes deposited transaction](../glossary.md#l1-attributes-deposited-transaction).

## Expiry Window

The expiry window is the time period after which an initiating message is no longer considered valid.

| Constant        | Value                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| `EXPIRY_WINDOW` | `604800 secs` (7 days) |

## Security Considerations

### Depositing an Executing Message

Deposit transactions (force inclusion transactions) give censorship resistance to layer two networks.
If it were possible to deposit an invalid executing message, this would force the sequencer to reorg. It would
be fairly cheap to continuously deposit invalid executing messages through L1 and cause L2 liveness
instability, therefore deposits are prevented from triggering executing messages.
A future upgrade may enable deposits to trigger executing messages.

### Expiry Window

The expiry window ensures that the proof can execute in a reasonable amount of time. [`EIP-2935`][eip-2935] introduced
the capability to traverse history with sub-linear complexity, however deep lookups remain expensive. App developers and
users, in the event that they encounter a message that has expired but has yet to be relayed, can
[resend the message][resend-msg] in order to complete the process.

### Reliance on History

When fully executing historical blocks, a dependency on historical receipts from remote chains is present.
[EIP-4444][eip-4444] will eventually provide a solution for making historical receipts available without
needing to execute increasingly long chain histories.
