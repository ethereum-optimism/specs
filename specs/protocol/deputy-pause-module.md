## Status

Proposed

## Overview

The `DeputyPauseModule` is a [Safe Module][safe-modules] designed to be installed into the Optimism
Foundation Operations Safe that allows a dedicated Deputy address to create an ECDSA signature that
authorizes the execution of the [Pause Mechanism](./superchain-config.md#pause-mechanism). The
`DeputyPauseModule` assumes that the Optimism Foundation Operations Safe is the Deputy Guardian
that is permitted to act within the `DeputyGuardianModule` installed into the Optimism Security
Council Safe.

## Context

Additional context and motivation for this component can be found in the corresponding
[design document][design-doc].

## Upgradeability

The `DeputyPauseModule` is not expected to change frequently and is therefore not a proxied
contract. The `DeputyPauseModule` allows basic parameters to be modified by the Operations Safe
directly without needing to deploy a new instance of the contract. Additionally, the address of the
module itself is only utilized within the Optimism Foundation Operations Safe and can be safely
replaced.

## Assumptions

> **NOTE**: Assumptions are utilized by specific invariants and do not apply globally. Invariants
> typically only rely on a subset of the following assumptions. Different invariants may rely on
> different assumptions. Refer to individual invariants for their dependencies.

### aSCP-001: Pause authorization process is well-defined

We assume that the process by which a pause can be authorized is well-defined such that the cases
in which the pause should and should not be triggered are apparent.

### aSCP-002: Pause authorization process is robust

We assume that the process by which a pause can be authorized correctly accounts for all cases in
which such a pause would be necessary.

### aSCP-003: Pause authorization process is fast

We assume that the process by which a pause can be authorized is fast acting such that it can make
the decision to trigger the pause within a short period of time of any situation that would require
such a pause.

### aDPM-001: Contract is configured correctly

We assume that all inputs to the contract are configured correctly including:

- Address of the Operations Safe.
- Address of the `DeputyGuardianModule`.
- Address of the `SuperchainConfig` contract.
- Address of the Deputy account.

#### Mitigations

- Verify a signature from the Deputy in the contract constructor.
- Verify the configured values in the deployment script.
- Generate and test a signature on testnet.
- Monitoring if the `DeputyGuardianModule` is not installed into the Security Council Safe.

### aDPM-002: Deputy key is not compromised

We assume that the Deputy key is maintained securely and is not compromised by a malicious actor.

#### Mitigations

- Enforce strong access control around the Deputy key.
- Monitoring for any usage of the Deputy key.
- Regular rotation of the Deputy key.

### aDPM-003: Deputy key is not deleted

We assume that the Deputy key has not been deleted by a malicious actor.

#### Mitigations

- Maintain duplicate copies of the key in multiple secure locations.

### aDPM-004: Ethereum will not censor transactions for extended periods of time

We assume that Ethereum will not censor transactions for an extended period of time and that any
transaction submitted to the network can be processed within a reasonable time bound (e.g., 1h).

#### Mitigations

- Extremely high priority fee if necessary.

### aDPM-005: DeputyGuardianModule pause function correctly triggers pause

We assume that the `pause` function exposed by the `DeputyGuardianModule` will correctly trigger
the [Pause Mechanism](./superchain-config.md#pause-mechanism) through the Guardian account. We
assume that this function will not carry out any other action.

#### Mitigations

- Existing audit on the `DeputyGuardianModule`.

### aDPM-006: OpenZeppelin ECDSA and EIP712 contracts are free of critical bugs

We assume that both the `ECDSA` library and the `EIP712` contract provided by OpenZeppelin V4 at
commit [ecd2ca2c][oz-v4.7.3] (v4.7.3) are free of any critical bugs that would cause their
behaviors to diverge from their specified behaviors.

#### Mitigations

- Existing audits/safety processes for OpenZeppelin V4.

### aDPM-007: Safe contracts are free of critical bugs

We assume that the Safe contract implementations used by the Security Council Safe and Optimism
Foundation Operations Safe are free of any critical bugs that would cause their behaviors to
diverge from their specified behaviors.

#### Mitigations

- Existing audits/safety processes for Safe.

### aDPM-008: Deputy key is capable of creating signatures

We assume that the Deputy key configured is actually capable of creating signatures.

#### Mitigations

- Signature verification when changing Deputy key.

## System Invariants

### iSCP-001: Pause can be activated within a short bounded time of authorization

It is an important system-level invariant that the pause functionality can be activated within a
short, bounded amount of time of its authorization by the standard process that approves the usage
of this pause.

#### Impact

**Severity: High (estimated)**

If this invariant is broken, various recovery options that rely on fast activation of the pause may
fail. We estimate the severity of this invariant being broken to be high but final severity will
depend on the formalization of other invariants that rely on this one.

#### Dependencies

- [aSCP-002](#ascp-002-pause-authorization-process-is-robust)
- [aSCP-003](#ascp-003-pause-authorization-process-is-fast)
- [iDPM-003](#idpm-003-deputy-must-always-be-able-to-act-through-the-module)
- [aDPM-001](#adpm-001-contract-is-configured-correctly)

### iSCP-002: Pause is not activated outside of the standard process

We must maintain that the pause is not activated outside of the standard process that approves the
usage of the pause.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If this invariant is broken, all components that rely on the pause would be placed into a paused
state unexpectedly. This would cause a temporary liveness failure for withdrawals through the
Standard Bridge system and would negatively impact users until liveness could be restored by either
the Guardian or the Deputy Guardian.

#### Dependencies

- [aSCP-001](#ascp-001-pause-authorization-process-is-well-defined)
- [iDPM-001](#idpm-001-only-the-deputy-may-act-through-the-module)
- [iDPM-004](#idpm-004-deputy-authorizations-must-not-be-replayable)
- [aDPM-002](#adpm-002-deputy-key-is-not-compromised)

## Component Invariants

### iDPM-001: Only the Deputy may act through the module

The Deputy account must be the only address that can act through the module. Other accounts can
execute an action on behalf of the Deputy if the account has a valid authorization signature from
the Deputy for that action. No account may act through the module other than with the explicit
authorization of the Deputy.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If this invariant is broken, accounts other than the Deputy would be able to carry out the actions
allowed by this module. Assuming that
[iDPM-002](#idpm-002-deputy-must-only-be-able-to-trigger-the-pause) holds, this
means that an account other than the Deputy would be able to trigger the pause, presumably without
the authorization of the social consensus process that typically triggers this pause.

#### Mitigations

- Signature verification on the pause action.
- Monitoring for pause triggering actions.

#### Dependencies

- [aDPM-006](#adpm-006-openzeppelin-ecdsa-and-eip712-contracts-are-free-of-critical-bugs)

### iDPM-002: Deputy must only be able to trigger the pause

The Deputy must only be able to trigger the pause action by causing the module to call the `pause`
function on the `DeputyGuardianModule`. The Deputy must not be able to trigger any other
priviledged action on behalf of the Guardian or Deputy Guardian.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If this invariant is broken, the Deputy would be able to cause the Optimism Foundation Operations
Safe to execute some unknown set of possible actions. We would treat this as a critical risk.

#### Mitigations

- Strict auditing and verification of the `DeputyPauseModule`.

#### Dependencies

- [aDPM-005](#adpm-005-deputyguardianmodule-pause-function-correctly-triggers-pause)
- [aDPM-007](#adpm-007-safe-contracts-are-free-of-critical-bugs)

### iDPM-003: Deputy must always be able to act through the module

The Deputy account must always be able to act through the module, even if the Deputy account
private key is compromised. Other than the total deletion of the Deputy key, there should not be
any condition in the contract itself that would prevent the key from being able to quickly and
efficiently execute the pause action.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If this invariant is broken, we would not be able to provide the system-level invariant that the
Deputy account can always be used to trigger the pause within a bounded amount of time of the
decision being made to carry out this action.

#### Mitigations

- Signature-based verification to bypass draining attacks.
- Strict auditing and verification of the `DeputyPauseModule`.

#### Dependencies

- [aDPM-001](#adpm-001-contract-is-configured-correctly)
- [aDPM-003](#adpm-003-deputy-key-is-not-deleted)
- [aDPM-004](#adpm-004-ethereum-will-not-censor-transactions-for-extended-periods-of-time)
- [aDPM-006](#adpm-006-openzeppelin-ecdsa-and-eip712-contracts-are-free-of-critical-bugs)
- [aDPM-008](#adpm-008-deputy-key-is-capable-of-creating-signatures)

### iDPM-004: Deputy authorizations must not be replayable

A Deputy authorization must apply to a specific `DeputyPauseModule` on a specific blockchain as
identified by its chain ID. An authorization created for one `DeputyPauseModule` must not be
reusable on any other `DeputyPauseModule`. An authorization must be usable once and the same
authorization must not be usable again in any `DeputyPauseModule`.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If this invariant is broken, a Deputy authorization created by the same Deputy address for
another `DeputyPauseModule` or a previous authorization for the same module could be reused and
would result in the pause being triggered outside of the standard process by which such a pause is
approved.

#### Mitigations

- EIP-712 signature verification including a specific contract address and chain ID.
- Enforce unique nonces on signatures to prevent signature reuse within the same contract.
- Utilize unique Deputy accounts for each module instance or network.

#### Dependencies

- [aDPM-006](#adpm-006-openzeppelin-ecdsa-and-eip712-contracts-are-free-of-critical-bugs)

### iDPM-005: Foundation Safe must be able to change the Deputy account easily

The Foundation Safe must be able to change the address of the Deputy account without significant
operational overhead.

### Impact

**Severity: Medium**

If this invariant is broken, it would not be possible for the Safe account to easily rotate the
Deputy account if the account is compromised. This creates operational overhead but is not a
security risk as we assume that the Safe code does not have bugs and therefore the Safe can always
remove the module if necessary.

### Mitigations

- Authorized function to change the Deputy address.

## iDPM-006: Safe must be able to change the DeputyGuardianModule address easily

The Foundation Safe must be able to change the address of the `DeputyGuardianModule` without
significant operational overhead.

### Impact

**Severity: Medium**

If this invariant is broken, it would not be possible for the Safe account to easily change the
`DeputyGuardianModule` address if this module is updated. This creates operational overhead but is
not a security risk as we assume that the Safe code does not have bugs and therefore the Safe can
always remove the module if necessary.

### Mitigations

- Authorized function to change the `DeputyGuardianModule` address.

### Assumptions

- [aDPM-007](#adpm-007-safe-contracts-are-free-of-critical-bugs)

## Implementation Spec
