## Overview

The GovernanceToken is an ERC20 token that serves as the governance token for the OP Stack. It enables token holders to
participate in governance through voting and delegation mechanisms while supporting controlled token inflation through
owner-managed minting.

## Definitions

N/A

## Assumptions

### aGT-001: Owner operates within governance constraints

The contract owner (MintManager) is trusted to mint tokens only in accordance with governance decisions and established
protocol rules.

#### Mitigations

- Owner is expected to be a governance-controlled MintManager contract
- MintManager enforces on-chain rate limits and caps on minting operations
- Ownership transfers are transparent and subject to community oversight

### aGT-002: ERC20Votes total supply constraint

The total token supply never exceeds 2^208 - 1 tokens, as required by the inherited ERC20Votes implementation to prevent
overflow in voting calculations.

#### Mitigations

- OpenZeppelin ERC20Votes implementation enforces this constraint in the _mint function
- The constraint provides sufficient headroom for any realistic token supply

## Invariants

### iGT-001: Voting power reflects delegated balance

The voting power of any address always equals the sum of token balances that have been delegated to that address.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If this invariant is violated, governance voting would become unreliable. Addresses could have voting power that
doesn't correspond to actual delegated tokens, allowing manipulation of governance decisions and undermining the
integrity of the voting system.

### iGT-002: Delegation does not restrict transfers

Token holders can always transfer their tokens regardless of whether they have delegated their voting power or whether
their tokens have been delegated to them by others.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If this invariant is violated, tokens would become illiquid when delegated, preventing normal token transfers and
breaking the fungibility of the token. This would severely impact the token's utility and market functionality.

### iGT-003: Unauthorized minting is impossible

Only the contract owner can successfully mint new tokens through the mint function.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If this invariant is violated, unauthorized parties could mint unlimited tokens, completely destroying the token's
economic value, diluting existing holders, and compromising the entire governance system.

- MUST emit DelegateVotesChanged events for both the previous and new delegates
- MUST NOT prevent the caller from transferring tokens after delegation

### delegateBySig

```solidity
function delegateBySig(address delegatee, uint256 nonce, uint256 expiry, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public
```

Delegates voting power using an EIP-712 signature, enabling gasless delegation.

**Parameters:**
- `delegatee`: The address to delegate voting power to
- `nonce`: The nonce for replay protection
- `expiry`: The timestamp after which the signature expires
- `v`: The recovery byte of the signature
- `r`: The first 32 bytes of the signature
- `s`: The second 32 bytes of the signature

**Behavior:**
- MUST revert if the signature has expired (block.timestamp > expiry)
- MUST revert if the nonce is incorrect for the signer
- MUST recover the signer address from the signature
- MUST revert if signature is invalid
- MUST perform delegation on behalf of the recovered signer address
- MUST increment the nonce for the signer
- MUST emit DelegateChanged and DelegateVotesChanged events as in delegate function

### getVotes

```solidity
function getVotes(address account) public view returns (uint256)
```

Returns the current voting power of an address.

**Parameters:**
- `account`: The address to query

**Behavior:**
- MUST return the current voting power delegated to `account`
- MUST reflect all delegations made up to the current block
- MUST NOT include tokens held by `account` unless they have delegated to themselves

### getPastVotes
