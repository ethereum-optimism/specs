The dependency set defines the set of chains that destination chains allow as source chains. Another way of
saying it is that the dependency set defines the set of initiating messages that are valid to be used
as part of an executing message. An executing message MUST have an initiating message that is created by a chain
in the dependency set.

The dependency set is defined by a set of chain ids. Since it is impossible to enforce uniqueness of chain ids,
social consensus MUST be used to determine the chain that represents the canonical chain id. This
particularly impacts the block builder as they SHOULD use the chain id to assist in validation
of executing messages.

Chains implicitly belong to their own Dependency Set.

Chains define their own dependency sets, but by convention chains are intended to
depend on one another in interop.

## Chain ID

The concept of a chain id was introduced in [EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) to prevent
replay attacks between chains. This EIP does not specify the max size of a chain id, although
[EIP-2294](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2294) attempts to add a maximum size. Since this EIP is
stagnant, all representations of chain ids MUST be the `uint256` type.

In the future, OP Stack chains reserve the right to use up to 32 bytes to represent a chain id. The
configuration of the chain should deterministically map to a chain id and with careful architecture
changes, all possible OP Stack chains in the superchain will be able to exist counterfactually.

It is a known issue that not all software in the Ethereum ecosystem can handle 32 byte chain ids.

## Updating the Dependency Set

The dependency set is managed in the client software. Adding a chain to the dependency set is
considered an upgrade to the network. It is not possible to remove chains from the dependency set.

## Security Considerations

### Dependency Set Size

It becomes increasingly expensive to fully validate the full cluster as the size of the dependency
set grows. The proof system requires validating all of the chains so the size of the dependency
set is limited by the performance of the proof.
