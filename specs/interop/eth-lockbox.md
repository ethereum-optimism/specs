## Overview

With interoperable ETH, withdrawals will fail if the referenced `OptimismPortal` lacks sufficient ETH.
This is due to having the possibility to move ETH liquidity across the different chains and it could happen
that a chain ends up with more liquidity than its `OptimismPortal`.
The `ETHLockbox` improves the Superchain's interoperable ETH withdrawal user experience and avoids this issue.
To do so, it unifies ETH L1 liquidity in a single contract (`ETHLockbox`), enabling seamless withdrawals of ETH
from any OP chain in the Superchain, regardless of where the ETH was initially deposited.

## Design

The `ETHLockbox` contract is designed to manage the unified ETH liquidity for the Superchain.
It implements two main functions: `lockETH` for depositing ETH into the lockbox,
and `unlockETH` for withdrawing ETH from the lockbox.

These functions are called by the `OptimismPortal` contracts to manage the shared ETH liquidity
when making deposits or finalizing withdrawals.

Authorization of `OptimismPortal`s is managed by the `ProxyAdmin` owner.
The `ETHLockbox` contract is proxied and managed by the L1 `ProxyAdmin`.

### Interface and properties

#### `lockETH`

Deposits and locks ETH into the lockbox's liquidity pool.

- The function MUST accept ETH.
- Only authorized `OptimismPortal` addresses MUST be allowed to interact.
- The function MUST NOT revert when called by an authorized `OptimismPortal`
- The function MUST emit the `ETHLocked` event with the `portal` that called it and the `amount`.

```solidity
function lockETH() external payable;
```

#### `unlockETH`

Withdraws a specified amount of ETH from the lockbox's liquidity pool to the `OptimismPortal` calling it.

- Only authorized `OptimismPortal` addresses MUST be allowed to interact.
- The function MUST NOT revert when called by an authorized `OptimismPortal` unless paused.
- The function MUST emit the `ETHUnlocked` event with the `portal` that called it and the `amount`.
- The function MUST use `donateETH` when sending ETH to avoid triggering deposits.

```solidity
function unlockETH(uint256 _value) external;
```

#### `authorizePortal`

Authorizes a `OptimismPortal` to interact with the `ETHLockbox`.

- Only the `ProxyAdmin` owner can call the function.
- The function MUST emit the `PortalAuthorized` event with the `portal`.

```solidity
function authorizePortal(address _portal) external;
```

#### `authorizeLockbox`

Authorizes another `ETHLockbox` to migrate its ETH liquidity to the current `ETHLockbox`.

- Only the `ProxyAdmin` owner can call the function.
- The function MUST emit the `LockboxAuthorized` event with the `lockbox` that is being authorized.

```solidity
function authorizeLockbox(address _lockbox) external;
```

#### `migrateLiquidity`

Migrates the ETH liquidity from the current `ETHLockbox` to another `ETHLockbox`.

- Only the `ProxyAdmin` owner can call the function.
- The `ProxyAdmin` owner of the source lockbox must be the same as the `ProxyAdmin` owner of the destination lockbox.
- The function MUST emit the `LiquidityMigrated` event with the `lockbox` that is being migrated to.

```solidity
function migrateLiquidity(address _lockbox) external;
```

#### `receiveLiquidity`

Receives the ETH liquidity from another `ETHLockbox`.

- Only an authorized `ETHLockbox` can call the function.
- The function MUST emit the `LiquidityReceived` event with the `lockbox` that is being received from.

```solidity
function receiveLiquidity() external payable;
```

### Events

#### `ETHLocked`

MUST be triggered when `lockETH` is called

```solidity
event ETHLocked(address indexed portal, uint256 amount);
```

#### `ETHUnlocked`

MUST be triggered when `unlockETH` is called

```solidity
event ETHUnlocked(address indexed portal, uint256 amount);
```

#### `PortalAuthorized`

MUST be triggered when `authorizePortal` is called

```solidity
event PortalAuthorized(address indexed portal);
```

#### `LockboxAuthorized`

MUST be triggered when `authorizeLockbox` is called

```solidity
event LockboxAuthorized(address indexed lockbox);
```

#### `LiquidityMigrated`

MUST be triggered when `migrateLiquidity` is called

```solidity
event LiquidityMigrated(address indexed lockbox);
```

#### `LiquidityReceived`

MUST be triggered when `receiveLiquidity` is called

```solidity
event LiquidityReceived(address indexed lockbox);
```

## Invariants

### System level invariants

- The ETH held in the `ETHLockbox` MUST never be less than the amount deposited but not yet withdrawn by the `OptimismPortal`s

- The ETH unlocked by any `OptimismPortal` MUST NOT exceed the available shared liquidity in the `ETHLockbox`.

- The total withdrawable ETH amount present on all the dependency set's chains MUST NEVER be more than the amount held
  by the `ETHLockbox` of the cluster
  > With "withdrawable amount", the ETH balance held on `ETHLiquidity` is excluded

### Contract level invariants

- It MUST allow only authorized portals to lock ETH

- It MUST allow only authorized portals to unlock ETH

- It MUST be in paused state if the `SuperchainConfig` is paused

- No Ether MUST flow out of the contract when in a paused state

- It MUST NOT trigger a new deposit when ETH amount is being unlocked from the `ETHLockbox` by the `OptimismPortal`

- It MUST allow only the `ProxyAdmin` owner to call the `authorizePortal`, `authorizeLockbox` and `migrateLiquidity` functions

- It MUST allow only authorized lockboxes to call the `receiveLiquidity` function

- It MUST migrate the whole ETH liquidity from the source `ETHLockbox` to the destination `ETHLockbox` when calling `migrateLiquidity`

- It MUST emit:

  - An `ETHLocked` event when locking ETH

  - An `ETHUnlocked` event when unlocking ETH

  - A `PortalAuthorized` event when authorizing a portal

  - A `LockboxAuthorized` event when authorizing a lockbox

  - A `LiquidityMigrated` event when migrating liquidity

  - A `LiquidityReceived` event when receiving liquidity

## Architecture

### ETH Management

- ETH is locked in the `ETHLockbox` when:

  - A portal migrates its ETH liquidity when updating

  - A deposit is made with ETH value on an authorized portal

- ETH is unlocked from the `ETHLockbox` when:

  - An authorized portal finalizes a withdrawal that requires ETH

### Merge process

The merge process is the process of migrating the ETH liquidity from one `ETHLockbox` to another.

- The destination `ETHLockbox` MUST call `authorizeLockbox` with the source `ETHLockbox` as argument.

- The source `ETHLockbox` MUST call `migrateLiquidity` with the destination `ETHLockbox` as argument.

- `migrateLiquidity` MUST call `receiveLiquidity` from the destination `ETHLockbox`.

This process ensures that the ETH liquidity is migrated from the source `ETHLockbox` to the correct destination `ETHLockbox`.
