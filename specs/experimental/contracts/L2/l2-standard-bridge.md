## Overview

The L2StandardBridge enables ETH and ERC20 token transfers between Ethereum L1 and an OP Stack L2 chain. It burns
L1-native tokens on L2 when withdrawing to L1 and mints them when finalizing deposits from L1. For L2-native tokens,
it escrows them when withdrawing to L1 and releases them when finalizing deposits from L1.

## Definitions

### OptimismMintableERC20

An ERC20 token that implements the IOptimismMintableERC20 or ILegacyMintableERC20 interface, allowing the bridge to
mint and burn tokens. These tokens are native to L1 and have a corresponding L2 representation that can be
minted/burned by the bridge.

### Native L2 Token

An ERC20 token that is native to the L2 chain and does not implement the OptimismMintableERC20 interface. These
tokens are escrowed in the bridge contract when withdrawn to L1 and released when deposits are finalized from L1.

## Assumptions

### a01-001: L1StandardBridge is trusted

The L1StandardBridge contract on L1 is trusted to only send valid finalization messages for legitimate deposits.

#### Mitigations

- The L1StandardBridge address is set during initialization and cannot be changed
- Cross-chain messages are authenticated through the L2CrossDomainMessenger

### a01-002: L2CrossDomainMessenger is trusted

The L2CrossDomainMessenger accurately validates cross-chain messages and correctly identifies the sender.

#### Mitigations

- The messenger is a system predeploy contract maintained by the protocol
- Message authentication uses the xDomainMessageSender mechanism

### a01-003: OptimismMintableERC20 tokens correctly implement mint and burn

OptimismMintableERC20 tokens correctly implement the mint and burn functions and accurately report their remote
token address.

#### Mitigations

- Token pair validation checks that the remote token matches the token's reported remoteToken or l1Token
- Tokens must implement the IOptimismMintableERC20 or ILegacyMintableERC20 interface

## Invariants

### i01-001: Users who deposit assets on L1 receive them on L2

Users who successfully deposit ETH or ERC20 tokens through the L1 bridge always receive the corresponding assets on
L2 when the deposit is finalized within a bounded time period (less than 1 day under normal operation).

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, users lose their assets permanently as the L1 assets are locked or burned but the L2 assets are never
received.

### i01-002: Users who withdraw assets on L2 can claim them on L1

Users who successfully initiate a withdrawal on L2 can always claim the corresponding assets on L1 after the
challenge period, provided the withdrawal is properly finalized on L1.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, users lose their assets permanently as the L2 assets are burned or escrowed but the L1 assets cannot
be claimed.

### i01-003: One-to-one custody across chains

For each bridged asset amount, exactly one of the following holds at any time: it is held on L1 by the bridge
(locked or in original form) or it is represented on L2 (minted or in original form). Transitions between these
states occur only through the canonical flows: a valid deposit locks or burns the asset on L1 and is paired with a
mint or release on L2; a valid withdrawal burns or escrows the asset on L2 and is paired with a release or mint on
L1. No other mechanism may create or release representations.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, attackers could mint arbitrary tokens on L2 without depositing the corresponding L1 tokens, or drain
the bridge by withdrawing more than was deposited, breaking the 1:1 correspondence between L1 and L2 assets.
