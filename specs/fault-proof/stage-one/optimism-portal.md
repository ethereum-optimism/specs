## Overview

The `OptimismPortal` contract is the primary interface for deposits and withdrawals between the L1
and L2 chains within an OP Stack system. The `OptimismPortal` contract allows users to create
"deposit transactions" on the L1 chain that are automatically executed on the L2 chain within a
bounded amount of time. Additionally, the `OptimismPortal` contract allows users to execute
withdrawal transactions by proving that such a withdrawal was initiated on the L2 chain. The
`OptimismPortal` verifies the correctness of these withdrawal transactions against Output Roots
that have been declared valid by the L1 Fault Proof system.

## Definitions

### Proof Maturity Delay

The **Proof Maturity Delay** is the minimum amount of time that a withdrawal must be a
[Proven Withdrawal](#proven-withdrawal) before it can be finalized.

### Proven Withdrawal

A **Proven Withdrawal** is a withdrawal transaction that has been proven against some Output Root
by a user. Users can prove withdrawals against any Dispute Game contract that meets the following
conditions:

- The game is a [Registered Game](./anchor-state-registry.md#registered-game)
- The game is not a [Retired Game](./anchor-state-registry.md#retired-game)
- The game has a game type that matches the current
  [Respected Game Type](./anchor-state-registry.md#respected-game-type)
- The game has not resolved in favor of the Challenger

Notably, the `OptimismPortal` allows users to prove withdrawals against games that are currently
in progress (games that are not [Resolved Games](./anchor-state-registry.md#resolved-game)).

Users may re-prove a withdrawal at any time. User withdrawals are stored on a per-user basis such
that re-proving a withdrawal cannot cause the timer for
[finalizing a withdrawal](#finalized-withdrawal) to be reset for another user.

### Finalized Withdrawal

A **Finalized Withdrawal** is a withdrawal transaction that was previously a Proven Withdrawal and
meets a number of additional conditions that allow the withdrawal to be executed.

Users can finalize a withdrawal if they have previously proven the withdrawal and their withdrawal
meets the following conditions:

- Withdrawal is a [Proven Withdrawal](#proven-withdrawal)
- Withdrawal was proven at least [Proof Maturity Delay](#proof-maturity-delay) seconds ago
- Withdrawal was proven against a game with a [Valid Claim](./anchor-state-registry.md#valid-claim)
- Withdrawal was not previously finalized

### Valid Withdrawal

A **Valid Withdrawal** is a withdrawal transaction that was correctly executed on the L2 system as
would be reported by a perfect oracle for the query.

### Invalid Withdrawal

An **Invalid Withdrawal** is any withdrawal that is not a [Valid Withdrawal](#valid-withdrawal).

### L2 Withdrawal Sender

The **L2 Withdrawal Sender** is the address of the account that triggered a given withdrawal
transaction on L2. The `OptimismPortal` is expected to expose a variable that includes this value
when [finalizing](#finalized-withdrawal) a withdrawal.

### Receive Default Gas Limit

The receive default gas limit is the gas limit provided for simple ETH deposits that are triggered
when a user sends ETH to the `OptimismPortal` via the `receive` function. This gas limit is
currently set to a value of 100000 gas.

### Minimum Gas Limit

The minimum gas limit is the minimum amount of L2 gas that must be purchased when creating a
deposit transaction. This limit increases linearly based on the size of the calldata to prevent
users from creating L2 resource usage without paying for it. The minimum gas limit is calculated
as: calldata_byte_count * 40 + 21000.

### Unsafe Target

An **Unsafe Target** is a target address that is considered unsafe for withdrawal or deposit
transactions. Unsafe targets include the OptimismPortal contract itself and the ETHLockbox
contract if the OptimismPortal is using an ETHLockbox. Targeting these addresses could potentially
create attack vectors.

### Block Output

A **Block Output**, commonly called an **Output**, is a data structure that wraps the key hash
elements of a given L2 block.

The structure of the Block Output is versioned (32 bytes). The current Block Output version is
`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (V0). A V0 Block Output has
the following structure:

```solidity
struct BlockOutput {
  bytes32 version;
  bytes32 stateRoot;
  bytes32 messagePasserStorageRoot;
  bytes32 blockHash;
}
```

Where:

- `version` is a version identifier that describes the structure of the Output Root
- `stateRoot` is the state root of the L2 block this Output Root corresponds to
- `messagePasserStorageRoot` is the storage root of the `L2ToL1MessagePasser` contract at the L2
  block this Output Root corresponds to
- `blockHash` is the block hash of the L2 block this Output Root corresponds to

### Output Root

An **Output Root** is a commitment to a [Block Output](#block-output). A detailed description of
this commitment can be found [on this page](../../protocol/proposals.md#l2-output-commitment-construction).

### Super Output

A **Super Output** is a data structure that commits all of the [Block Outputs](#block-output) for
all chains within the Superchain Interop Set at a given timestamp. A Super Output can also commit
to a single Block Output to maintain compatibility with chains outside of the Interop Set.

The structure of the Super Output is versioned (1 byte). The current version is `0x01` (V1). A V1
Super Output has the following structure:

```solidity
struct OutputRootWithChainId {
  uint256 chainId;
  bytes32 root;
}

struct SuperOutput {
  uint64 timestamp;
  OutputRootWithChainid[] outputRoots;
}
```

The output root for each chain in the super root MUST be for the block with a timestamp where
$Time_S - BlockTime < Time_B <= Time_S$ where $Time_S$ is the super root timestamp, $BlockTime$ is the chain block time
and $Time_B$ is the block timestamp. That is the output root must be from the last possible block at or before the super
root timestamp.

The output roots in the super root MUST be sorted by chain ID ascending.

### Super Root

A **Super Root** is a commitment to a [Super Output](#super-output), computed as:

```solidity
keccak256(encodeSuperRoot(SuperRoot))
```

Where `encodeSuperRoot` for the V1 Super Output is:

```solidity
function encodeSuperRoot(SuperRoot memory root) returns (bytes) {
  require(root.outputRoots.length > 0); // Super Root must have at least one Output Root.
  return concat(
    0x01, // Super Root version byte
    root.timestamp,
    [
      concat(outputRoot.chainId, outputRoot.root)
      for outputRoot
      in root.outputRoots
    ]
  );
}
```

## Assumptions

### aOP-001: Dispute Game contracts properly report important properties

We assume that the `FaultDisputeGame` and `PermissionedDisputeGame` contracts properly and
faithfully report the following properties:

- Game type
- L2 block number
- Root claim value
- Game extra data
- Creation timestamp
- Resolution timestamp
- Resolution result
- Whether the game was the respected game type at creation

We also specifically assume that the game creation timestamp and the resolution timestamp are not
set to values in the future.

#### Mitigations

- Existing audit on the `FaultDisputeGame` contract
- Integration testing

### aOP-002: DisputeGameFactory properly reports its created games

We assume that the `DisputeGameFactory` contract properly and faithfully reports the games it has
created.

#### Mitigations

- Existing audit on the `DisputeGameFactory` contract
- Integration testing

### aOP-003: Incorrectly resolving games will be invalidated before they have Valid Claims

We assume that any games that are resolved incorrectly will be invalidated either by
[blacklisting](./anchor-state-registry.md#blacklisted-game) or by
[retirement](./anchor-state-registry.md#retired-game) BEFORE they are considered to have
[Valid Claims](./anchor-state-registry.md#valid-claim).

Proper Games that resolve in favor the Defender will be considered to have Valid Claims after the
[Dispute Game Finality Delay](./anchor-state-registry.md#dispute-game-finality-delay-airgap) has
elapsed UNLESS the Pause Mechanism is active. Therefore, in the absence of the Pause Mechanism,
parties responsible for game invalidation have exactly the Dispute Game Finality Delay to
invalidate a withdrawal after it resolves incorrectly. If the Pause Mechanism is active, then any
incorrectly resolving games must be invalidated before the pause is deactivated.

#### Mitigations

- Stakeholder incentives / processes
- Incident response plan
- Monitoring

## Dependencies

- [iASR-001](./anchor-state-registry.md#iasr-001-games-are-represented-as-proper-games-accurately)
- [iASR-002](./anchor-state-registry.md#iasr-002-all-valid-claims-are-truly-valid-claims)

## Invariants

### iOP-001: Invalid Withdrawals can never be finalized

We require that [Invalid Withdrawals](#invalid-withdrawal) can never be
[finalized](#finalized-withdrawal) for any reason.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If this invariant is broken, any number of arbitrarily bad outcomes could happen. Most obviously,
we would expect all bridge systems relying on the `OptimismPortal` to be immediately compromised.

### iOP-002: Valid Withdrawals can always be finalized in bounded time

We require that [Valid Withdrawals](#valid-withdrawal) can always be
[finalized](#finalized-withdrawal) within some reasonable, bounded amount of time.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If this invariant is broken, we would expect that users are unable to withdraw bridged assets. We
see this as a critical system risk.

`0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD` and should not be used.

### proveWithdrawalTransaction (Output Roots)
