## Design Goals

The aim is to design a protocol specification that is:

- **Fast:** When sending transactions, rollup clients return reliable confirmations with
  low-latency. For example when swapping on Uniswap you should see that your transaction
  succeeds in less than 2 seconds.
- **Scalable:** It should be possible to handle an enormous number of transactions
  per second which will enable the system to charge low fees. The gas limit should
  scale up to and even past the gas limit on L1.
- **Modular:** Components are modular, reducing complexity and enable parallel contributions.
  Robust conceptual frameworks and composable atoms of software enables complex protocol design
  that exceeds the knowledge base of any single contributor.
- **Minimal:** Rollups should be minimal by using Ethereumâ€™s battle-tested infrastructure. An ideal
  optimistic rollup design should be representable as a _diff_ against Ethereum client software.
- **Developer Driven:** Designs are driven by technical contributors so developers are
  stakeholders. There should be a tight feedback loop between protocol design and developer use.
- **Clear and Readable:** The specs are articulated well. Iterative technical feedback is key!
- **Secure:** Every component of the system is incredibly secure and highly redundant. Assets
  are at stake, so the design must be robust to mitigate risk.
- **Decentralizable:** Designed to avail the protocol of the security and censorship-resistant
  guarantees achieved by a decentralized system.
  Currently centralized components of the system should have a clear path towards decentralization.
  Already decentralized components of the system should be protected and preserved.
