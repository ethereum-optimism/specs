The OP Contracts Manager is a contract that deploys the L1 contracts for an OP Stack chain in a single
transaction. It provides a minimal set of user-configurable parameters to ensure that the resulting
chain meets the [standard configuration] requirements.

The version deployed is always a governance-approved contract release. The set
of governance approved [contract releases] can be found on the
[Optimism Monorepo releases] page, and is the set of releases named
`op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`.

## Deployment

The OP Contracts Manager is a proxied contract deployed at `0xTODO`. It can be deployed as follows:

TODO.

## Interface

Version 1.0.0 of the OP Contracts Manager deploys the [`op-contracts/v1.6.0`]
contracts release.

### `Proxy.sol`

The OP Contracts Manager is a proxied contract using the standard `Proxy.sol` contract that lives in
the Optimism monorepo. Therefore the OP Contracts Manager will have the same interface as the
`Proxy.sol`, in addition to other methods defined in this specification.

The privileged methods of the OP Contracts Manager will be held by the L1 ProxyAdmin owner, as
specified by the [standard configuration].

### `deploy`

The `deploy` method is the only non-view method in the contract. It is used to
deploy the full set of L1 contracts required to setup a new OP Stack chain that
complies with the [standard configuration]. It has the following interface:

```solidity
struct Roles {
  address proxyAdminOwner;
  address systemConfigOwner;
  address batcher;
  address unsafeBlockSigner;
  address proposer;
  address challenger;
}

function deploy(
  uint256 l2ChainId,
  uint32 basefeeScalar,
  uint32 blobBasefeeScalar,
  Roles roles
) external returns (SystemConfig)
```

The `l2ChainId` has the following restrictions:

- It must not be equal to 0.
- It must not be equal to the chain ID of the chain the OP Contracts Manager is
deployed on.
- It must not be equal to a chain ID that is already present in the
[ethereum-lists/chains] repository. This is not enforced onchain, but may matter
for future versions of OP Contracts Manager that handle upgrades.

On success, the following event is emitted:

```solidity
event Deployed(uint256 indexed l2ChainId, SystemConfig indexed systemConfig);
```

This method reverts on failure. This occurs when:

- The input `l2ChainId` does not comply with the restrictions above.
- The resulting configuration is not compliant with the [standard configuration].

### Getter Methods

The following interface defines the available getter methods:

```solidity
/// @notice The logic address and initializer selector for an implementation contract.
struct Implementation {
  address logic; // Address containing the deployed logic contract.
  bytes4 initializer; // Function selector for the initializer.
}

/// @notice Returns the latest approved release of the OP Stack contracts.
/// @notice Release strings follow semver and are named with the
/// format `op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`.
function latestRelease() external view returns (string memory);

/// @notice Maps a release version to a contract name to its implementation data.
function implementation(
  string memory release,
  string memory contractName
) external view returns (Implementation memory);

/// @notice Maps an L2 Chain ID to the SystemConfig address for that chain.
/// @notice All contracts for a chain can be found from its SystemConfig.
function systemConfig(uint256 chainId) external view returns (SystemConfig);
```

## Implementation

### Batch Inbox Address

The chain's [Batch Inbox] address is computed at deploy time using the recommend approach defined
in the [standard configuration]. This improves UX by removing an input, and ensures uniqueness of
the batch inbox addresses.

### Contract Deployments

All contracts deployed by the OP Contracts Manager are deployed with CREATE2, with a
salt equal to either:

- The L2 chain ID, or
- `keccak256(bytes.concat(bytes32(uint256(l2ChainId)), contractName))`.

The former is used when only a single instance of a given contract is deployed for a chain.
The latter is used when deploying multiple instances of a given contract for a chain,
which is the case of all `Proxy` contracts. For these, the `contractName`
is the name of the implementation contract that will be used with the proxy.

This provides the following benefits:

- Contract addresses for a chain can be derived as a function of chain ID without any RPC calls.
- Chain ID uniqueness is enforced for free, as a deploy using the same chain ID
will result in attempting to deploy to the same address, which is prohibited by
the EVM.
  - This property is contingent on the proxy and `AddressManager` code not
  changing when OP Contracts Manager is upgraded. Both of these are not planned to
  change.
  - The OP Contracts Manager is not responsible for enforcing chain ID uniqueness, so it is acceptable
  if this property is not preserved in future versions of the OP Contracts Manager.

## Security Considerations

### Chain ID Source of Truth

One of the implicit restrictions on chain ID is that `deploy` can only be called
once per chain ID, because contract addresses are a function of chain ID. However,
future versions of OP Contracts Manager may:

- Change the Proxy code used, which would allow a duplicate chain ID to be deployed
if there is only the implicit check.
- Manage upgrades, which will require "registering" existing pre-OP Contracts Manager
chains in the OP Contracts Manager. Registration will be a privileged action, and the [superchain registry] will be
used as the source of truth for registrations.

This means, for example, if deploying a chain with a chain ID of 10—which is OP
Mainnet's chain ID—deployment will execute successfully, but the entry in OP
Stack Manager may be overwritten in a future upgrade. Therefore, chain ID
uniqueness is not enforced by the OP Contracts Manager, and it is strongly
recommended to only use chain IDs that are not already present in the
[ethereum-lists/chains] repository.

### Chain ID Frontrunning

Contract addresses for a chain are a function of chain ID, which implies you
can counterfactually compute and use those chain addresses before the chain is
deployed. However, this property should not be relied upon—new chain deployments
are permissionless, so you cannot guarantee usage of a given chain ID, as deploy
transactions can be frontrun.

### Chain ID Value

While not specific to OP Contracts Manager, when choosing a chain ID is important
to consider that not all chain IDs are well supported by tools. For example,
MetaMask [only supports](https://gist.github.com/rekmarks/a47bd5f2525936c4b8eee31a16345553)
chain IDs up to `4503599627370476`, well below the max allowable 256-bit value.

OP Contracts Manager does not consider factors such as these. The EVM supports
256-bit chain IDs, so OP Contracts Manager sticks with the full 256-bit range to
maximize compatibility.

### Proxy Admin Owner

The proxy admin owner is a very powerful role, as it allows upgrading protocol
contracts. When choosing the initial proxy admin owner, a Safe is recommended
to ensure admin privileges are sufficiently secured.

### Upgradeability (ABI Changes)

This contract is upgradeable, and breaking changes are expected, as upgrades
are required to update the contracts release that is deployed. This is because
the required inputs to the `deploy` method may change as new contract releases
are supported. Therefore, if calling this contract from another contract, be
sure to account for future breaking changes to the ABI.
