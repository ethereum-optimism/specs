## About Optimism

[Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/) is a project dedicated to scaling Ethereum's technology and expanding its ability to
coordinate people from across the world to build effective decentralized economies and governance systems. The
[Optimism Collective](https://www.optimism.io/vision) builds open-source software that powers scalable blockchains and
aims to address key governance and economic challenges in the wider Ethereum ecosystem. Optimism operates on the
principle of **impact=profit**, the idea that individuals who positively impact the Collective should be proportionally
rewarded with profit.

**Change the incentives and you change the world.**

## About the OP Stack

The OP Stack is a decentralized software stack maintained by the OP Stack that forms the backbone of blockchains like
[OP Mainnet](https://explorer.optimism.io/) and [Base](https://base.org). The OP Stack is designed to be aggressively
open-source â€” you are welcome to explore, modify, and extend the OP Stack to your heart's content.
