Two new system level predeploys are introduced for managing cross chain messaging along with
an update to the `L1Block` contract with additional functionality.

## CrossL2Inbox

| Constant | Value                                        |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Address  | `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000022` |

The `CrossL2Inbox` is responsible for executing a cross chain message on the destination chain.
It is permissionless to execute a cross chain message on behalf of any user.

To ensure safety of the protocol, the [Message Invariants](./messaging.md#messaging-invariants) must be enforced.

### Message execution arguments

The following fields are required for executing a cross chain message:

[message payload]: ./messaging.md#message-payload
[`Identifier`]: ./messaging.md#message-identifier

| Name      | Type         | Description                                             |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `_msg`    | `bytes`      | The [message payload], matching the initiating message. |
| `_id`     | `Identifier` | A [`Identifier`] pointing to the initiating message.    |
| `_target` | `address`    | Account that is called with `_msg`.                     |

#### `_msg`

The [message payload] of the executing message.

This must match the emitted payload of the initiating message identified by `_id`.

#### `_id`

A pointer to the `_msg` in a remote (or local) chain.

The message [`Identifier`] of the executing message.
This is required to enforce the message executes an existing and valid initiating message.

By including the [`Identifier`] in the calldata, it makes static analysis much easier for block builders.
It is impossible to check that the [`Identifier`] matches the cross chain message on chain. If the block
builder includes a message that does not correspond to the [`Identifier`], their block will be reorganized
by the derivation pipeline.

A possible upgrade path to this contract would involve adding a new function. If any fields in the [`Identifier`]
change, then a new 4byte selector will be generated by solc.

#### `_target`

Messages are broadcast, not directed. Upon execution the caller can specify which `address` to target:
there is no protocol enforcement on what this value is.

The `_target` is called with the `_msg` as input.
In practice, the `_target` will be a contract that needs to know the schema of the `_msg` so that it can be decoded.
It MAY call back to the `CrossL2Inbox` to authenticate
properties about the `_msg` using the information in the `Identifier`.

### Reference implementation

A simple implementation of the `executeMessage` function is included below.

```solidity
function executeMessage(Identifier calldata _id, address _target, bytes calldata _msg) public payable {
    require(msg.sender == tx.origin);
    require(_id.timestamp <= block.timestamp);
    require(L1Block.isInDependencySet(_id.chainid));

    assembly {
      tstore(ORIGIN_SLOT, _id.origin)
      tstore(BLOCKNUMBER_SLOT, _id.blocknumber)
      tstore(LOG_INDEX_SLOT, _id.logIndex)
      tstore(TIMESTAMP_SLOT, _id.timestamp)
      tstore(CHAINID_SLOT, _id.chainid)
    }

    bool success = SafeCall.call({
      _target: _target,
      _value: msg.value,
      _calldata: _msg
    });

    require(success);
}
```

Note that the `executeMessage` function is `payable` to enable relayers to earn in the gas paying asset.

### `Identifier` Getters

The `Identifier` MUST be exposed via `public` getters so that contracts can call back to authenticate
properties about the `_msg`.

## L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger

| Constant          | Value                                        |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Address           | `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000023` |
| `MESSAGE_VERSION` | `uint256(0)`                                 |

The `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` is a higher level abstraction on top of the `CrossL2Inbox` that
provides features necessary for secure transfers ERC20 tokens between L2 chains.
Messages sent through the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` on the source chain receive both replay protection
as well as domain binding, ie the executing transaction can only be valid on a single chain.

### `relayMessage` Invariants

- Only callable by the `CrossL2Inbox`
- The `Identifier.origin` MUST be `address(L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger)`
- The `_destination` chainid MUST be equal to the local chainid
- The `CrossL2Inbox` cannot call itself

### Message Versioning

Versioning is handled in the most significant bits of the nonce, similarly to how it is handled by
the `CrossDomainMessenger`.

```solidity
function messageNonce() public view returns (uint256) {
    return Encoding.encodeVersionedNonce(nonce, MESSAGE_VERSION);
}
```

### No Native Support for Cross Chain Ether Sends

To enable interoperability between chains that use a custom gas token, there is no native support for
sending `ether` between chains. `ether` must first be wrapped into WETH before sending between chains.

### Interfaces

The `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` uses a similar interface to the `L2CrossDomainMessenger` but
the `_minGasLimit` is removed to prevent complexity around EVM gas introspection and the `_destination`
chain is included instead.

#### Sending Messages

The initiating message is represented by the following event:

```solidity
event SentMessage(bytes message) anonymous;
```

The `bytes` are an ABI encoded call to `relayMessage`. The event is defined as `anonymous` so that no topics
are prefixed to the abi encoded call.

An explicit `_destination` chain and `nonce` are used to ensure that the message can only be played on a single remote
chain a single time. The `_destination` is enforced to not be the local chain to avoid edge cases.

There is no need for address aliasing as the aliased address would need to commit to the source chain's chain id
to create a unique alias that commits to a particular sender on a particular domain and it is far more simple
to assert on both the address and the source chain's chain id rather than assert on an unaliased address.
In both cases, the source chain's chain id is required for security. Executing messages will never be able to
assume the identity of an account because `msg.sender` will never be the identity that initiated the message,
it will be the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger` and users will need to callback to get the initiator of the message.

```solidity
function sendMessage(uint256 _destination, address _target, bytes calldata _message) external {
    require(_destination != block.chainid);

    bytes memory data = abi.encodeCall(L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger.relayMessage, (_destination, block.chainid, messageNonce(), msg.sender, _target, _message));
    emit SentMessage(data);
    nonce++;
}
```

Note that `sendMessage` is not `payable`.

#### Relaying Messages

When relaying a message through the `L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger`, it is important to require that
the `_destination` equal to `block.chainid` to ensure that the message is only valid on a single
chain. The hash of the message is used for replay protection.

It is important to ensure that the source chain is in the dependency set of the destination chain, otherwise
it is possible to send a message that is not playable.

```solidity
function relayMessage(uint256 _destination, uint256 _source, uint256 _nonce, address _sender, address _target, bytes memory _message) external payable {
    require(msg.sender == address(CROSS_L2_INBOX));
    require(_destination == block.chainid);
    require(CROSS_L2_INBOX.origin() == address(this));
    require(_target != address(this));

    bytes32 messageHash = keccak256(abi.encode(_destination, _source, _nonce, _sender, _target, _message));
    require(sentMessages[messageHash] == false);

    assembly {
      tstore(CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSAGE_SENDER_SLOT, _sender)
      tstore(CROSS_DOMAIN_MESSAGE_SOURCE_SLOT, _source)
    }

    bool success = SafeCall.call({
       _target: _target,
       _value: msg.value,
       _calldata: _message
    });

    require(success);

    sentMessages[messageHash] = true;
}
```

Note that the `relayMessage` function is `payable` to enable relayers to earn in the gas paying asset.

To enable cross chain authorization patterns, both the `_sender` and the `_source` MUST be exposed via `public`
getters.

## L1Block

| Constant | Value                                        |
|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| Address  | `0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000015` |

The `L1Block` contract is updated to include the set of allowed chains. The L1 Attributes transaction
sets the set of allowed chains. The `L1Block` contract MUST provide a public getter to check if a particular
chain is in the dependency set called `isInDependencySet(uint256)`. This function MUST return true when
the chain's chain id is passed in as an argument.

The `setL1BlockValuesInterop()` function MUST be called on every block after the interop upgrade block.
The interop upgrade block itself MUST include a call to `setL1BlockValuesEcotone`.

### L1Attributes

The L1 Atrributes transaction is updated to include the dependency set. Since the dependency set is dynamically sized,
a `uint8` "interopSetSize" parameter prefixes tightly packed `uint256` values that represent each chain id.

| Input arg         | Type                     | Calldata bytes          | Segment |

| baseFeeScalar     | uint32                   | 4-7                     | 1       |

| blobBaseFee       | uint256                  | 68-99                   | 3       |
| l1BlockHash       | bytes32                  | 100-131                 | 4       |
| batcherHash       | bytes32                  | 132-163                 | 5       |
| interopSetSize    | uint8                    | 164-165                 | 6       |
| chainIds          | uint256\[interopSetSize] | 165-(32*interopSetSize) | 6+      |
