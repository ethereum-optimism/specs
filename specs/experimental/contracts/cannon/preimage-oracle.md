## Overview

The PreimageOracle provides data availability for fault proof execution by storing preimage data indexed by
cryptographic keys. It supports multiple preimage types including local data, hash-based preimages, blob data, and
precompile results. For large preimages that cannot be submitted in a single transaction, it implements a Large
Preimage Proposal system with a challenge mechanism to ensure data integrity.

## Definitions

N/A

## Assumptions

### a01-001: Challengers Monitor Proposals

Honest challengers monitor Large Preimage Proposals and challenge any proposals with incorrect keccak256 computations
during the challenge period.

#### Mitigations

- Challenge period provides sufficient time for monitoring
- Bond incentivizes challenges by rewarding successful challengers
- Proposals are publicly observable through events and storage

### a01-002: Sufficient Gas for Precompile Calls

Callers of loadPrecompilePreimagePart provide sufficient gas to execute the precompile call as specified by the
requiredGas parameter.

#### Mitigations

- Contract enforces minimum gas check before calling precompile
- Reserved gas buffer accounts for call setup overhead

## Invariants

### i01-001: Preimage Data Integrity

Once a preimage part is marked as available (preimagePartOk is true), the stored data at that key and offset never
changes and always corresponds to the correct preimage for that key.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If preimage data could be modified after being stored, fault proofs could be invalidated or manipulated, allowing
invalid state transitions to be proven valid or preventing valid proofs from being generated.

### i01-002: Large Preimage Proposal Finality

Once a Large Preimage Proposal passes the challenge period without being countered, the preimage data it represents
becomes permanently available and cannot be modified or removed.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If finalized proposals could be modified or removed, fault proofs depending on that data would fail, breaking the
security guarantees of the fault proof system.

### i01-003: Challenge Correctness

A Large Preimage Proposal can only be successfully challenged if it contains an incorrect keccak256 state transition,
and all proposals with incorrect state transitions can be successfully challenged.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If incorrect proposals could pass unchallenged or correct proposals could be falsely challenged, the integrity of the
preimage data would be compromised, allowing invalid fault proofs or preventing valid ones.

### i01-004: Bond Conservation

The total ETH held in proposal bonds equals the sum of all active proposal bonds, and bonds are only transferred to
the claimant (on successful squeeze) or challenger (on successful challenge).

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If bonds could be lost or stolen, the economic security of the Large Preimage Proposal system would be compromised,
reducing incentives for honest behavior.

### i01-005: Local Data Isolation

Preimage data loaded via loadLocalData for a given caller and local context can only be written by that specific
caller, ensuring isolation between different callers' local data.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If local data could be overwritten by other callers, fault proofs could be manipulated by providing incorrect local
context data, compromising the security of the dispute resolution process.
