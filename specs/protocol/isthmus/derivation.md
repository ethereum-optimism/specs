# Network upgrade block rules

## Upgrade Gas

Starting with Isthmus, a change to the gas limit of upgrade blocks is introduced to ensure that
upgrade transactions cannot run out of gas:
If a hardfork activation block contains upgrade deposit transactions, the total sum of all upgrade
transaction's gas limits, called *upgrade gas*, is added to the gas limit of the payload attributes.

Before this change, it was possible that a chain with a low gas limit would not have enough gas to
execute all upgrade transactions. Note that the default *system transaction max gas* is `1e6` and
the only constraint on the *block gas limit* is that it has to be larger or equal to the *system
transaction max gas* plus the *max resource limit* (default: `2e7`, may fully be consumed by user
deposit transactions). So if the L1 deposit transaction plus upgrade transactions would consume more
than the *system transaction max gas*, there was a risk of running out of gas.

## Omission of user transactions

Starting with Isthmus, network upgrade blocks must not contain any non-deposit transactions, to
avoid any unintended interplay of user transactions with upgrade transactions.

This is checked at the batch stage. So if a batch of an upgrade block is not empty, it is considered
invalid and the rules for dropped batches apply.

## Isthmus network upgrade automation transactions

The Isthumus hardfork activation block contains the following transactions, in this order:

- L1 Attributes Transaction
- User deposits from L1
- Network Upgrade Transactions
  - L1Block deployment
  - GasPriceOracle deployment
  - Operator Fee vault deployment
  - Update L1Block Proxy ERC-1967 Implementation
  - Update GasPriceOracle Proxy ERC-1967 Implementation
  - Update Operator Fee vault Proxy ERC-1967 Implementation
  - GasPriceOracle Enable Isthmus
  - EIP-2935 Contract Deployment

To not modify or interrupt the system behavior around gas computation, this block will not include any sequenced
transactions by setting `noTxPool: true`.

### L1Block deployment

The `L1Block` contract is upgraded to support the Isthmus operator fee feature.

A deposit transaction is derived with the following attributes:

- `from`: `0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000003`
- `to`: `null`
- `mint`: `0`
- `value`: `0`
- `gasLimit`: `425,000`
- `data`: `0x60806040523480156100105...` ([full bytecode](../../static/bytecode/isthmus-l1-block-deployment.txt))
- `sourceHash`: `0x3b2d0821ca2411ad5cd3595804d1213d15737188ae4cbd58aa19c821a6c211bf`,
  computed with the "Upgrade-deposited" type, with `intent = "Isthmus: L1 Block Deployment"

This results in the Isthmus L1Block contract being deployed to `0xFf256497D61dcd71a9e9Ff43967C13fdE1F72D12`, to verify:

```bash
cast compute-address --nonce=0 0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000003
Computed Address: 0xFf256497D61dcd71a9e9Ff43967C13fdE1F72D12
```

Verify `sourceHash`:

```bash
cast keccak $(cast concat-hex 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 $(cast keccak "Isthmus: L1 Block Deployment"))
# 0x3b2d0821ca2411ad5cd3595804d1213d15737188ae4cbd58aa19c821a6c211bf
```

Verify `data`:

```bash
git checkout TODO
make build-contracts
jq -r ".bytecode.object" packages/contracts-bedrock/forge-artifacts/L1Block.sol/L1Block.json
```

This transaction MUST deploy a contract with the following code hash
`TODO`.

### GasPriceOracle deployment

The `GasPriceOracle` contract is also upgraded to support the Isthmus operator fee feature.

A deposit transaction is derived with the following attributes:

- `from`: `0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000004`
- `to`: `null`
- `mint`: `0`
- `value`: `0`

- `data`: `0x60806040523480156100105...` ([full bytecode](../../static/bytecode/isthmus-gas-price-oracle-deployment.txt))
- `sourceHash`: `0xfc70b48424763fa3fab9844253b4f8d508f91eb1f7cb11a247c9baec0afb8035`,
  computed with the "Upgrade-deposited" type, with `intent = "Isthmus: Gas Price Oracle Deployment"

This results in the Isthmus GasPriceOracle contract being deployed to `0x93e57A196454CB919193fa9946f14943cf733845`, to verify:

```bash
cast compute-address --nonce=0 0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000003

- Withdrawal network: L2

- `from`: `0x4210000000000000000000000000000000000005`
- `to`: `null`

  computed with the "Upgrade-deposited" type, with `intent = "Isthmus: Operator Fee Vault Deployment"

This results in the Isthmus OperatorFeeVault contract being deployed to

### EIP-2935 Contract Deployment

[EIP-2935](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2935) requires a contract to be deployed. To deploy this contract,
a deposit transaction is created with attributes matching the EIP:

- `from`: `0xE9f0662359Bb2c8111840eFFD73B9AFA77CbDE10`
- `to`: `null`,
- `mint`: `0`
- `value`: `0`
- `gasLimit`: `250,000`
- `data`: `0x60538060095f395ff33373fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffe14604657602036036042575f35600143038111604257611fff81430311604257611fff9006545f5260205ff35b5f5ffd5b5f35611fff60014303065500`,
- `sourceHash`: `0xbfb734dae514c5974ddf803e54c1bc43d5cdb4a48ae27e1d9b875a5a150b553a`
  computed with the "Upgrade-deposited" type, with `intent = "Isthmus: EIP-2935 Contract Deployment"

This results in the EIP-2935 contract being deployed to `0x0F792be4B0c0cb4DAE440Ef133E90C0eCD48CCCC`, to verify:

```bash
cast compute-address --nonce=0 0xE9f0662359Bb2c8111840eFFD73B9AFA77CbDE10
Computed Address: 0x0F792be4B0c0cb4DAE440Ef133E90C0eCD48CCCC
```

Verify `sourceHash`:

```bash
cast keccak $(cast concat-hex 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002 $(cast keccak "Isthmus: EIP-2935 Contract Deployment"))
# 0xbfb734dae514c5974ddf803e54c1bc43d5cdb4a48ae27e1d9b875a5a150b553a
```

This transaction MUST deploy a contract with the following code hash
`0x6e49e66782037c0555897870e29fa5e552daf4719552131a0abce779daec0a5d`.

# Span Batch Updates

[Span batches](../delta/span-batches.md) are a span of consecutive L2 blocks than are batched submitted.

Span batches contain the L1 transactions and transaction types that are posted containing the span of L2 blocks.
Since [EIP-7702] introduces a new transaction type, the Span Batch must be updated to support the [EIP-7702]
transaction.

This corresponds with a new RLP-encoding of the `tx_datas` list as specified in
[the Delta span batch spec](../delta/span-batches.md), adding a new transaction type:

Transaction type `4` ([EIP-7702] `SetCode`):
`0x04 ++ rlp_encode(value, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, data, access_list, authorization_list)`

The [EIP-7702] transaction extends [EIP-1559] to include a new `authorization_list` field.
`authorization_list` is an RLP-encoded list of authorization tuples.
The [EIP-7702] transaction format is as follows.

- `value`: The transaction value as a `u256`.
- `max_priority_fee_per_gas`: The maximum priority fee per gas allowed as a `u256`.
- `max_fee_per_gas`: The maximum fee per gas as a `u256`.
- `data`: The transaction data bytes.
- `access_list`: The [EIP-2930] access list.
- `authorization_list`: The [EIP-7702] signed authorization list.

## Activation

Singular batches with transactions of type `4` must only be accepted if Isthmus is active at the
timestamp of the batch. If a singular batch contains a transaction of type `4` before Isthmus is
active, this batch must be *dropped*. Note that if Holocene is active, this will also
lead to the remaining span batch, and channel that contained it, to get dropped.

Also note that this check must happen at the level of individual batches that are derived from span
batches, not to span batches as a whole. In particular, it is allowed for a span batch to span the
Isthmus activation timestamp and contain SetCode transactions in singular batches that have a
timestamp at or after the Isthmus activation time, even if the timestamp of the span batch is before
the Isthmus activation time.
