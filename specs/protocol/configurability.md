When deploying the OP Stack software to a production environment,
certain parameters about the protocol can be configured. These
configurations can include a variety of parameters which affect the
resulting properties of the blockspace in question.

There are four categories of OP Stack configuration options:

- **Consensus Parameters**: Parameters and properties of the chain that may
  be set at genesis and fixed for the lifetime of the chain, or may be
  changeable through a privileged account or protocol upgrade.
- **Policy Parameters**: Parameters of the chain that might be changed without
  breaking consensus. Consensus is enforced by the protocol, while policy parameters
  may be changeable within constraints imposed by consensus.
- **Admin Roles**: These roles can upgrade contracts, change role owners,
  or update protocol parameters. These are typically cold/multisig wallets not
  used directly in day to day operations.
- **Service Roles**: These roles are used to manage the day-to-day
  operations of the chain, and therefore are often hot wallets.

Each category also defines the standard configuration values for it's given parameters.
Standard configuration is the set of requirements for an OP Stack chain to be considered a
Standard Chain within the superchain.
These requirements are currently a draft, pending governance approval.

The recommended way to deploy L1 contracts for an OP chain that meet the standard configuration will be with the
[OP Stack Manager](../experimental/op-stack-manager.md).
