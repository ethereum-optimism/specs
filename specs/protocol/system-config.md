## Overview

The `SystemConfig` is a contract on L1 that can emit rollup configuration changes as log events.
The rollup [block derivation process](derivation.md) picks up on these log events and applies the
changes. `SystemConfig` generally acts as the source of truth for configuration values within an
OP Stack chain.

## Definitions

### Batch Inbox

The **Batch Inbox** is the address that Sequencer transaction batches are published to. Sequencers
publish transactions to the Batch Inbox by setting it as the `to` address on a transaction
containing batched L2 transactions either in calldata or as blobdata.

### Batcher Hash

The **Batcher Hash** identifies the sender(s) whose transactions to the [Batch Inbox](#batch-inbox)
will be recognized by the L2 clients for a given OP Chain.

The Batcher Hash is versioned by the first byte of the hash. The structure of the V0 Batcher Hash
is a 32 byte hash defined as follows:

| 1 byte         | 11 bytes | 20 bytes |
| -------------- | -------- | -------- |
| version (0x00) | empty    | address  |

This can also be understood as:

```solidity
bytes32(address(batcher))
```

Where `batcher` is the address of the account that sends transactions to the Batch Inbox. Put
simply, the V0 hash identifies a _single_ address whose transaction batches will be recognized by
L2 clients. This hash is versioned so that it could, for instance, be repurposed to be a commitment
to a list of permitted accounts or some other form of batcher identification.

### Fee Scalars

The **Fee Scalars** are parameters used to calculate the L1 data fee for L2 transactions. These
parameters are also known as Gas Price Oracle (GPO) parameters.

#### Pre-Ecotone Parameters

Before the Ecotone upgrade, these include:

- **Scalar**: A multiplier applied to the L1 base fee, interpreted as a big-endian `uint256`
- **Overhead**: A constant gas overhead, interpreted as a big-endian `uint256`

#### Post-Ecotone Parameters

After the Ecotone upgrade:

- The **Scalar** attribute encodes additional scalar information in a versioned encoding scheme
- The **Overhead** value is ignored and does not affect the L2 state-transition output

#### Post-Ecotone Scalar Encoding

The Scalar is encoded as big-endian `uint256`, interpreted as `bytes32`, and composed as follows:

- Byte `0`: scalar-version byte
- Bytes `[1, 32)`: depending on scalar-version:
  - Scalar-version `0`:
    - Bytes `[1, 28)`: padding, should be zero
    - Bytes `[28, 32)`: big-endian `uint32`, encoding the L1-fee `baseFeeScalar`
    - This version implies the L1-fee `blobBaseFeeScalar` is set to 0
    - If there are non-zero bytes in the padding area, `baseFeeScalar` must be set to MaxUint32
  - Scalar-version `1`:
    - Bytes `[1, 24)`: padding, must be zero
    - Bytes `[24, 28)`: big-endian `uint32`, encoding the `blobBaseFeeScalar`
    - Bytes `[28, 32)`: big-endian `uint32`, encoding the `baseFeeScalar`

The `baseFeeScalar` corresponds to the share of the user-transaction (per byte) in the total
regular L1 EVM gas usage consumed by the data-transaction of the batch-submitter. For blob
transactions, this is the fixed intrinsic gas cost of the L1 transaction.

The `blobBaseFeeScalar` corresponds to the share of a user-transaction (per byte) in the total
blobdata that is introduced by the data-transaction of the batch-submitter.

### Unsafe Block Signer

The **Unsafe Block Signer** is an Ethereum address whose corresponding private key is used to sign
"unsafe" blocks before they are published to L1. This signature allows nodes in the P2P network to
recognize these blocks as the canonical unsafe blocks, preventing denial of service attacks on the
P2P layer.

To ensure that its value can be fetched with a storage proof in a storage layout independent
manner, it is stored at a special storage slot corresponding to
`keccak256("systemconfig.unsafeblocksigner")`.

Unlike other system config parameters, the Unsafe Block Signer only operates on blockchain policy
and is not a consensus level parameter.

### L2 Gas Limit

The **L2 Gas Limit** defines the maximum amount of gas that can be used in a single L2 block.
This parameter ensures that L2 blocks remain of reasonable size to be processed and proven.

Changes to the L2 gas limit are fully applied in the first L2 block with the L1 origin that
introduced the change, as opposed to the 1/1024 adjustments towards a target as seen in limit
updates of L1 blocks.

The gas limit may not be set to a value larger than the
[maximum gas limit](./configurability.md#gas-limit). This is to ensure that L2 blocks are fault
provable and of reasonable size to be processed by the client software.

## Functionality

### System Config Updates

System config updates are signaled through the `ConfigUpdate(uint256,uint8,bytes)` event. The event
structure includes:

- The first topic determines the version (unknown versions are critical derivation errors)
- The second topic determines the type of update (unknown types are critical derivation errors)
- The remaining event data encodes the configuration update

In version `0`, the following update types are supported:

- Type `0`: `batcherHash` overwrite, as `bytes32` payload
- Type `1`: Pre-Ecotone, `overhead` and `scalar` overwrite, as two packed `uint256` entries. After
  Ecotone upgrade, `overhead` is ignored and `scalar` is interpreted as a versioned encoding that
  updates `baseFeeScalar` and `blobBaseFeeScalar`
- Type `2`: `gasLimit` overwrite, as `uint64` payload
- Type `3`: `unsafeBlockSigner` overwrite, as `address` payload
- Type `4`: `eip1559Params` overwrite, as `uint256` payload encoding denomination and elasticity
- Type `5`: `operatorFeeParams` overwrite, as `uint256` payload encoding scalar and constant
