## Overview

The L1StandardBridge enables ETH and ERC20 token transfers between Ethereum L1 and an OP Stack L2 chain. It escrows
L1-native tokens when depositing to L2 and releases them when finalizing withdrawals from L2. For L2-native tokens, it
mints them when finalizing withdrawals and burns them when depositing to L2.

## Definitions

### OptimismMintableERC20

An ERC20 token that implements the IOptimismMintableERC20 or ILegacyMintableERC20 interface, allowing the bridge to
mint and burn tokens. These tokens are native to L2 and have a corresponding L1 representation that can be
minted/burned by the bridge.

### Native L1 Token

An ERC20 token that is native to the L1 chain and does not implement the OptimismMintableERC20 interface. These tokens
are escrowed in the bridge contract when deposited to L2 and released when withdrawals are finalized from L2.

## Assumptions

### a01-001: L2StandardBridge is trusted

The L2StandardBridge contract on L2 is trusted to only send valid finalization messages for legitimate withdrawals.

#### Mitigations

- The L2StandardBridge address is set during initialization and cannot be changed
- Cross-chain messages are authenticated through the L1CrossDomainMessenger

### a01-002: L1CrossDomainMessenger is trusted

The L1CrossDomainMessenger accurately validates cross-chain messages and correctly identifies the sender.

#### Mitigations

- The messenger is set during initialization and cannot be changed
- Message authentication uses the xDomainMessageSender mechanism

### a01-003: SystemConfig and SuperchainConfig are trusted

The SystemConfig and SuperchainConfig contracts accurately report the paused state and are controlled by trusted
governance.

#### Mitigations

- The SystemConfig address is set during initialization by the ProxyAdmin or its owner
- The pause mechanism provides emergency protection against detected issues

### a01-004: OptimismMintableERC20 tokens correctly implement mint and burn

OptimismMintableERC20 tokens correctly implement the mint and burn functions and accurately report their remote token
address.

#### Mitigations

- Token pair validation checks that the remote token matches the token's reported remoteToken or l1Token
- Tokens must implement the IOptimismMintableERC20 or ILegacyMintableERC20 interface

## Invariants

### i01-001: Users who deposit assets on L1 receive them on L2

Users who successfully deposit ETH or ERC20 tokens through the L1 bridge always receive the corresponding assets on L2
when the deposit is finalized within a bounded time period (less than 1 day under normal operation).

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, users lose their assets permanently as the L1 assets are locked or burned but the L2 assets are never
received.

### i01-002: Users who withdraw assets from L2 can claim them on L1

Users who successfully initiate a withdrawal on L2 can always claim the corresponding assets on L1 after the challenge
period, provided the withdrawal is properly finalized on L1.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, users lose their assets permanently as the L2 assets are burned or escrowed but the L1 assets cannot be
claimed.

### i01-003: One-to-one custody across chains

For each bridged asset amount, exactly one of the following holds at any time: it is held on L1 by the bridge (locked
or in original form) or it is represented on L2 (minted or in original form). Transitions between these states occur
only through the canonical flows: a valid deposit locks or burns the asset on L1 and is paired with a mint or release
on L2; a valid withdrawal burns or escrows the asset on L2 and is paired with a release or mint on L1. No other
mechanism may create or release representations.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, attackers could mint arbitrary tokens on L2 without depositing the corresponding L1 tokens, or drain the
bridge by withdrawing more than was deposited, breaking the 1:1 correspondence between L1 and L2 assets.
