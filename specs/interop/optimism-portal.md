## Overview

The `OptimismPortal` contract is integrated with the `ETHLockbox` for managing unified ETH liquidity.
This liquidity consists of every ETH balance migrated from each `OptimismPortal` when joining
the op-governed dependency set.

It is possible to upgrade to this version without being part of the op-governed dependency set. In this case,
the corresponding chain would need to deploy and manage its own `ETHLockbox`.

### Integrating `ETHLockbox`

The integration with the `ETHLockbox` involves locking ETH when executing deposit transactions and unlocking ETH
when finalizing withdrawal transactions, without altering other aspects of the current `OptimismPortal` implementation.

## Interface and properties

### ETH Management

#### `migrateLiquidity`

Migrates the ETH liquidity to the `ETHLockbox`. This function will only be called once by the
`ProxyAdmin` owner when updating the `OptimismPortal` contract.

```solidity
function migrateLiquidity() external;
```

- MUST only be callable by the `ProxyAdmin` owner
- MUST transfer all ETH balance to the `ETHLockbox`
- MUST emit an `ETHMigrated` event with the amount transferred

### Internal ETH Functions

#### `_lockETH`

Called during deposit transactions to handle ETH locking.

```solidity
function _lockETH() internal;
```

- MUST be called during `depositTransaction` when there is ETH value
- MUST lock any ETH value in the `ETHLockbox`
- MUST NOT revert on zero value

#### `_unlockETH`

Called during withdrawal finalization to handle ETH unlocking.

```solidity
function _unlockETH(uint256 _amount) internal;
```

- MUST be called during withdrawal finalization when there is ETH value
- MUST unlock the withdrawal value from the `ETHLockbox`
- MUST NOT revert on zero value
- MUST revert if withdrawal target is the `ETHLockbox`

## Events

### `ETHMigrated`

MUST be triggered when the ETH liquidity is migrated to the `ETHLockbox`.

```solidity
event ETHMigrated(uint256 amount);
```

## Invariants

- Deposits MUST lock the ETH in the `ETHLockbox`

- Withdrawals MUST unlock the ETH from the `ETHLockbox` and forward it to the withdrawal target

- The contract MUST NOT hold any ETH balance from deposits or withdrawals

- The contract MUST be able to handle zero ETH value operations

- The contract MUST NOT allow withdrawals to target the `ETHLockbox` address

- The contract MUST only migrate liquidity once
