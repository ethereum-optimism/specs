## Overview

New derivation rules are added to guarantee integrity of cross chain messages.
The fork choice rule is updated to fork out unsafe blocks that contain invalid
executing messages.

## Invariants

- An executing message MUST have a corresponding initiating message
- The initiating message referenced in an executing message MUST come from a chain in its dependency set
- A block MUST be considered invalid if it is built with any invalid executing messages
- The timestamp of the identifier MUST be greater than or equal to the interop network upgrade timestamp
- The timestamp of the identifier MUST be less than or equal to the timestamp of the block that includes it
- The timestamp of the identifier MUST be greater than timestamp of the block that includes it minus the expiry window

L2 blocks that produce invalid executing messages MUST not be allowed to be considered safe.
They MAY optimistically exist as unsafe blocks for some period of time. An L2 block that is invalidated
because it includes invalid executing messages MUST be replaced by a deposits only block at the same
block height. This guarantees progression of the chain, ensuring that an infinite loop of processing
the same block in the proof system is not possible.

## Replacing Invalid Blocks

When the [cross chain dependency resolution](./messaging.md#resolving-cross-chain-safety) determines
that a block contains an [invalid message](./messaging.md#invalid-messages), the block is replaced
by a block with the same inputs, except for the transactions included. The transactions from the
original block are trimmed to include only deposit transactions plus an
[optimistic block info deposit transaction](#optimistic-block-deposited-transaction), which is appended
to the trimmed transaction list.

### Optimistic Block Deposited Transaction

An Optimistic Block Deposited Transaction is a system deposited transaction,
inserted into the replacement block,
to signal when a previously derived local-safe block (the "optimistic" block) was invalidated.

This transaction MUST have the following values:

1. `from` is `0xdeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead0002`, like the address of the
   [L1 Attributes depositor account](../protocol/deposits.md#l1-attributes-depositor-account), but incremented by 1
2. `to` is `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` (the zero address as no EVM code execution is expected).
3. `mint` is `0`
4. `value` is `0`
5. `gasLimit` is set `36000` gas, to cover intrinsic costs, processing costs, and margin for change.
6. `isSystemTx` is set to `false`.
7. `data` is the preimage of the [L2 output root]
   of the replaced block. i.e. `version_byte || payload` without applying the `keccak256` hashing.
8. `sourceHash` is computed with a new deposit source-hash domain, see below.

This system-initiated transaction for L1 attributes is not charged any ETH for its allocated
`gasLimit`, as it is considered part of state-transition processing.

#### Optimistic Block Source-hash

The source hash is [computed](../protocol/deposits.md#source-hash-computation)
with a source-hash domain: `4` (instead of `1`),
combined with the [L2 output root] of the optimistic block that was invalidated.

The source-hash is thus computed as:
`keccak256(bytes32(uint256(4)), outputRoot))`.

## Network Upgrade Transactions

The interop network upgrade timestamp defines the timestamp at which all functionality in this document is considered
the consensus rules for an OP Stack based network. On the interop network upgrade block, a set of deposit transaction
based upgrade transactions are deterministically generated by the derivation pipeline in the following order:

- L1 Attributes Transaction calling `setL1BlockValuesIsthmus`
- User deposits from L1
- Network Upgrade Transactions
  - CrossL2Inbox deployment
  - L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger deployment
  - OptimismMintableERC20Factory deployment
  - Update CrossL2Inbox Proxy ERC-1967 Implementation Slot
  - Update L2ToL2CrossDomainMessenger Proxy ERC-1967 Implementation Slot
  - Update the OptimismMintableERC20Factory Proxy ERC-1967 Implementation Slot

The execution payload MUST set `noTxPool` to `true` for this block.

## Expiry Window

The expiry window is the time period after which an initiating message is no longer considered valid.

| Constant | Value |
| -------- | ----- |
| `EXPIRY_WINDOW` | `2592000` (30 days) |

The expiry window ensures that the proof can execute in a reasonable amount of time.
The proof program needs to walk back and re-execute to reproduce the consumed logs. This means
that very old logs are more expensive to prove.

## Security Considerations

### Depositing an Executing Message

Deposit transactions (force inclusion transactions) give censorship resistance to layer two networks.
It is possible to deposit an invalid executing message, forcing the sequencer to reorg. It would
be fairly cheap to continuously deposit invalid executing messages through L1 and cause L2 liveness
instability. A future upgrade will enable deposits to trigger executing messages.

### Reliance on History

When fully executing historical blocks, a dependency on historical receipts from remote chains is present.
[EIP-4444][eip-4444] will eventually provide a solution for making historical receipts available without
needing to execute increasingly long chain histories.
