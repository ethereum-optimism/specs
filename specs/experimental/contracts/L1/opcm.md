## Overview

OPContractsManager (OPCM) is the contract that defines network upgrades for OP Stack smart contracts.
Each OPCM instance represents a specific [Contract Release](#contract-release) and holds immutable
references to the implementation contracts for that release.

OPCM provides three core capabilities:

- **System Deployment**: Deploying all L1 contracts for a new OP Stack [System](#system) at the
  version the OPCM represents. This capability is permissionless.
- **System Upgrade**: Upgrading the L1 contracts of an existing [System](#system) to the version
  the OPCM represents. This capability is designed to be invoked via delegatecall by the ProxyAdmin
  owner, as OPCM itself holds no special authority.
- **SuperchainConfig Upgrade**: Upgrading the SuperchainConfig contract. This capability is
  designed to be invoked via delegatecall by the
  [Superchain ProxyAdmin Owner](#superchain-proxyadmin-owner).

OPCM is fully immutable with no mutable state. Implementation addresses are set at deployment time
and cannot be changed.

## Definitions

### System

All of the smart contracts that comprise a single OP Stack chain, including but not limited to
SystemConfig, OptimismPortal, L1CrossDomainMessenger, L1StandardBridge, DisputeGameFactory, and
associated proxy contracts.

### Contract Release

The version identifier for an OP Stack smart contracts release, following the format
`op-contracts/vX.Y.Z`. Each Contract Release uses a specific [OPCM Version](#opcm-version).

### OPCM Version

The version of the OPContractsManager contract itself, which may differ from the
[Contract Release](#contract-release) version. The OPCM Version reflects the capabilities and
interface of the upgrader rather than the contracts it deploys.

### Extra Instructions

A migration mechanism used during upgrades to set state values. Extra Instructions can be used to
bootstrap new state that has no predecessor value (e.g., when an upgrade introduces a new variable)
or to change state that already has a predecessor value. Each OPCM must specify which Extra
Instructions are permitted, and those Extra Instructions must not be permitted in OPCMs of higher
major versions. Permanent inputs should be added to the interface rather than implemented via Extra
Instructions.

### Superchain ProxyAdmin Owner

The ProxyAdmin owner for the SuperchainConfig contract. Since SuperchainConfig is shared across
multiple chains on a network (many-to-one relationship), it has its own governance-controlled
ProxyAdmin owner separate from individual chain ProxyAdmin owners.

## Assumptions

### a01-001: Ethereum Environment

OPCM is designed to run on Ethereum L1 mainnet and Sepolia. Behavior on other networks is not
guaranteed.

#### Mitigations

- Documentation clearly states Ethereum L1 mainnet and Sepolia as the target environments
- Testing is performed against Ethereum L1 mainnet and Sepolia

### a01-002: Implementation Contracts Trusted

The implementation contracts referenced by OPCM are trusted and correct for the release they
represent.

#### Mitigations

- Audited verification scripts confirm deployed bytecode matches the release commit. Verification
  scripts must be re-audited when changed.
- Implementation addresses are immutable once OPCM is deployed

### a01-003: Code at Release Commit is Safe

The code at the GitHub commit that the [Contract Release](#contract-release) represents is safe
and has not been tampered with.

#### Mitigations

- Release commits undergo security audits
- Multiple reviewers approve release commits
- Cryptographic signatures verify commit integrity

### a01-004: ProxyAdmin Owner Trusted for Upgrades

The ProxyAdmin owner invoking system upgrades is trusted and operating within governance
constraints.

#### Mitigations

- System upgrade capability only functions when delegatecalled, as OPCM holds no authority itself
- ProxyAdmin ownership is typically controlled by governance multisigs

### a01-005: Superchain ProxyAdmin Owner Trusted

The [Superchain ProxyAdmin Owner](#superchain-proxyadmin-owner) is trusted and operating within
governance constraints when upgrading SuperchainConfig.

#### Mitigations

- SuperchainConfig upgrade capability only functions when delegatecalled
- Superchain governance controls the Superchain ProxyAdmin Owner
- SuperchainConfig changes affect multiple chains, requiring heightened governance scrutiny

## Invariants

### i01-001: Code Integrity

OPCM must faithfully deploy or upgrade to the code at the GitHub commit that the
[Contract Release](#contract-release) was created at. OPCM must not deploy code that is not
present in that commit.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, malicious or incorrect code could be deployed to production systems, potentially
resulting in loss of funds, unauthorized access, or system compromise across all affected chains.

### i01-002: Atomicity

System deployment and upgrade operations must be atomic. They either fully succeed or fully
revert with no partial state changes.

#### Impact

**Severity: Critical**

If violated, a [System](#system) could be left in an inconsistent state where some contracts are
upgraded and others are not, potentially breaking cross-contract invariants and rendering the
system unusable or insecure.

### i01-003: No Unexpected Mutations

During system deployment or upgrade, system variables must never be mutated unless one of the
following conditions is met:

1. The user explicitly supplies an input requesting that change
2. OPCM deliberately mutates the value with clear documentation explaining why the mutation is
   necessary, and the change is safe to make

Properties such as ProxyAdmin ownership must be fetched from the existing system during upgrades
and preserved without modification.

#### Impact

**Severity: High/Critical**

If violated, upgrades could silently change critical system properties like ownership, potentially
transferring control to unauthorized parties or breaking the security model of the system.

### i01-004: Upgrade Ordering

Chains must follow the correct upgrade flow. Valid upgrade paths are:

- Same major version to a higher minor version (e.g., v1.2.0 to v1.3.0). Skipping minor versions is
  permitted, as a new increased minor version represents a replacement of the previous minor
  version.
- Current major version to the next major version (e.g., v1.x.y to v2.0.0)

Downgrades and skipping major versions are not permitted.

#### Impact

**Severity: High/Critical**

If violated, chains could skip critical migration steps or security patches, potentially leaving
them in an unsupported or vulnerable state that diverges from the expected upgrade path.

### i01-005: Initialization Safety

Contracts deployed or upgraded by OPCM must never be left uninitialized or open to
re-initialization.

#### Impact

**Severity: High/Critical**

If violated, attackers could initialize contracts with malicious parameters, potentially taking
ownership of critical system components or corrupting system state.

### i01-006: SuperchainConfig Backwards Compatibility

SuperchainConfig must maintain backwards compatibility with all OP Stack versions starting from
`op-contracts/v1.3.0` (MCP L1).

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If violated, chains running older OP Stack versions that depend on SuperchainConfig could break,
potentially halting operations for multiple chains simultaneously.

### i01-007: Single Operation Gas Feasibility

Given valid parameters, a single system deployment or upgrade operation must always be executable
within the gas limits of an Ethereum block.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If violated, it would be impossible to deploy new chains or upgrade existing chains, effectively
breaking the core functionality of OPCM and blocking all future upgrades.

### i01-008: Batch Operation Gas Efficiency

Multiple upgrade operations (approximately 5) should be executable within a single transaction.

#### Impact

**Severity: Low**

If violated, upgrading multiple chains would require separate transactions, increasing operational
complexity and cost but not blocking functionality.

### i01-009: Time Independence

OPCM behavior must not depend on time. Given the same inputs and environment state, OPCM must
produce the same results regardless of when it is called. OPCM itself must not be the source of
any time-dependent behavior.

Individual contracts deployed or upgraded by OPCM may have time-dependent initialization behavior
(e.g., storing a timestamp on first initialization). Such behavior must be carefully considered
and clearly documented in those specific contracts. However, this time-dependence must originate
from the contract's own logic, not from OPCM.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If violated, OPCM behavior would become unpredictable and potentially exploitable. Time-dependent
logic could cause operations to fail unexpectedly, create windows of vulnerability, or allow
manipulation based on timing.

### i01-010: PermissionedDisputeGame Fallback Preservation

Systems that use the FaultDisputeGame must also have a PermissionedDisputeGame. OPCM must not
disable or remove the PermissionedDisputeGame from such systems.

#### Impact

**Severity: High**

If violated, the system would lose its safe fallback mechanism. The PermissionedDisputeGame
provides a trusted dispute resolution path that can be used if issues are discovered with the
permissionless FaultDisputeGame, ensuring the system can continue operating safely.
